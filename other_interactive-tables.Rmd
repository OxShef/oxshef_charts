# Interactive tables

Interactive tables are extremely useful for presenting data directly to your audience for them to explore, much like an Excel document. Interactivity typically includes; ability to filter individual columns, reorder columns in ascending/descending order and a filter across the entire table. Often conditional formatting is applied to tables to highlight/label data.

Required Data:

- Table of data: This data could conceivable be of any type, and include columns of multiple data types including but not limited to text, numbers, images and more

Below is a minimal example of an interactive table using `R` and the `DT` library.

```{r basic_barchart, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("DT")
library("tidyverse")
library("gapminder")

gapminder %>%
  datatable(width = "100%",
            height = "250px",
            rownames = FALSE,
            options = list(pageLength = 5))

```
