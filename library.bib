abstract = {Hydrophobins are structural proteins produced by filamentous fungi that are amphiphilic and function through self-assembling into structures such as membranes. They have diverse roles in the growth and development of fungi, for example in adhesion to substrates, for reducing surface tension to allow aerial growth, in forming protective coatings on spores and other structures. Hydrophobin membranes at the air-water interface and on hydrophobic solids are well studied, but understanding how hydrophobins can bind to a polar surface to make it more hydrophobic has remained unresolved. Here we have studied different class II hydrophobins for their ability to bind to polar surfaces that were immersed in buffer solution. We show here that the binding under some conditions results in a significant increase of water contact angle (WCA) on some surfaces. The highest contact angles were obtained on cationic surfaces where the hydrophobin HFBI has an average WCA of 62.6° at pH 9.0, HFBII an average of 69.0° at pH 8.0 and HFBIII had an average WCA of 61.9 ° at pH 8.0. The binding of the hydrophobins to the positively charged surface was shown to depend on both pH and ionic strength. The results are significant for understanding the mechanism for formation of structures such as the surface of mycelia or fungal spore coatings as well as for possible technical applications.},

abstract = {Magnetotactic bacteria biomineralize iron into magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles that are surrounded by lipid vesicles. These 'magnetosomes' have considerable potential for use in bio- and nanotechnological applications because of their narrow size and shape distribution and inherent biocompatibility. The ability to tailor the magnetic properties of magnetosomes by chemical doping would greatly expand these applications; however, the controlled doping of magnetosomes has so far not been achieved. Here, we report controlled in vivo cobalt doping of magnetosomes in three strains of the bacterium Magnetospirillum. The presence of cobalt increases the coercive field of the magnetosomes--that is, the field necessary to reverse their magnetization--by 36-45{\%}, depending on the strain and the cobalt content. With elemental analysis, X-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, we estimate the cobalt content to be between 0.2 and 1.4{\%}. These findings provide an important advance in designing biologically synthesized nanoparticles with useful highly tuned magnetic properties.},

@article{Vekilov2010,
abstract = {The formation of crystalline nanoparticles starts with nucleation and control of nucleation is crucial for the control of the number, size, perfection, polymorph modification and other characteristics of particles. Recently, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the mechanism of nucleation of crystals in solution. The most significant of these is the two-step mechanism of nucleation, according to which the crystalline nucleus appears inside pre-existing metastable clusters of size several hundred nanometers, which consist of dense liquid and are suspended in the solution. While initially proposed for protein crystals, the applicability of this mechanism has been demonstrated for small-molecule organic and inorganic materials, colloids, and biominerals. This mechanism helps to explain several long-standing puzzles of crystal nucleation in solution: nucleation rates which are many orders of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions, nucleation kinetic dependencies with steady or receding parts at increasing supersaturation, the role of heterogeneous substrates for polymorph selection, the significance of the dense protein liquid, and others. More importantly, this mechanism provides powerful tools for control of the nucleation process by varying the solution thermodynamic parameters so that the volume occupied by the dense liquid shrinks or expands.},

Different morphology, from spheres to ellipsoidal particles with axial ratio up to approximately 10, was obtained by adding to the initial solution increasing amounts of phosphate anions up to 7 x 10(-3) M. The main targets of this work are the reduction in particle size and precipitation time and the increase of the particles axial ratio, keeping a narrow particle size distribution, in comparison to other methods previously developed to obtain homogenous alpha-Fe2O3 particles. A detailed analysis of the reaction products and a systematic study of the influence of the different precipitation conditions on the characteristics of the resulting particles have been carried out. Finally, some information on the formation mechanism of the ellipsoidal hematite particles in the iron (III) salt-urea-phosphate system is also given. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The behaviour of calcium phosphate (CaP) based biomaterials in biological environments determines how they can be used in vivo. The prime requirement for CaP materials to be bioactive and bond to living bone is the formation of a bone-like apatite layer on their surface. This phenomenon can be reproduced in vitro using simulated body fluid (SBF): a protein-free solution with ion concentrations similar to those of human blood plasma. Although proteins are unanimously considered as important actors in CaP material bioactivity and biomineralization processes, a certain confusion exists about their role as promotors or inhibitors of mineral crystal formation or both. The adsorption of proteins on the mineral surface can alter the nucleation rate and lead to antagonistic effects depending on the concentration of the adsorbed proteins. The ambiguity of this general effect is illustrated by the action of albumin on calcium phosphate crystallization on type I collagen and several other examples found in the literature.},

abstract = {Magnetosomes are magnetite nanoparticles formed by biomineralization within magnetotactic bacteria. Although there have been numerous genetic and proteomic studies of the magnetosome-formation process, there have been only limited and inconclusive studies of mineral-phase evolution during the formation process, and no real-time studies of such processes have yet been performed. Thus, suggested formation mechanisms still need substantiating with data. Here we report the examination of the magnetosome material throughout the formation process in a real-time in vivo study of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, strain MSR-1. Transmission EM and x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies reveal that full-sized magnetosomes are seen 15 min after formation is initiated. These immature magnetosomes contain a surface layer of the nonmagnetic iron oxide-phase hematite. Mature magnetite is found after another 15 min, concurrent with a dramatic increase in magnetization. This rapid formation result is contrary to previously reported studies and discounts the previously proposed slow, multistep formation mechanisms. Thus, we conclude that the biomineralization of magnetite occurs rapidly in magnetotactic bacteria on a similar time scale to high-temperature chemical precipitation reactions, and we suggest that this finding is caused by a biological catalysis of the process.},

abstract = {This thesis represents one of the first empirical studies of Open Data development in the UK and USA. Through content analysis of web apps and interviews with key players in the Open Data field, it analyses the range of uses to which Open Data is put, the motivations of both suppliers and developers of Open Data, and finally—most importantly—the role powerful intermediaries are having on these information flows. It emerges that, although intermediaries are present in other media such as online news provision and web search, they are yet to take a hold in the Open Data sphere. The effect is twofold: it leaves Open Data development free and distributed, but facing tough issues of organisation and discoverability. Most Open Data developers work alone and surprisingly few combine datasets from different sources. The Open Data ‘community' is in fact more a constellation of independent, task-focussed communities, with little overlap. Thus, if power brokers are to appear, they will be sited between these communities: either as data sources with information suitable for multiple contexts, or as data developers with contacts and skills in a number of areas. In these key positions, such intermediaries would hold a good deal of power over which data are released and how they are used. While such figures are by no means a threat to Open Data development, this thesis lays important groundwork for more thorough future research into how intermediaries' power can be best applied to ensure the future of innovative Open Data participation.},

In contrast to the classical mechanism of atom/molecule mediated growth of a single crystal, the particle mediated growth and assembly mechanisms are summarized as "non-classical crystallization", including exiting processes like oriented attachment and mesocrystal formation. Detailed investigations of non-classical crystallization mechanisms are a recent development, but evidence for these pathways is rapidly increasing in the literature. A major driving force for these investigations originates from biomineralization, because it seems that these crystallization routes are frequently applied by natural organisms. We give a non-exhaustive literature survey on these two mechanisms with a focus on recent examples and studies, which are dedicated to a mechanistic understanding. Furthermore, conditions are introduced for which these non-classical crystallization mechanisms can be expected, as they are always an alternative reaction pathway to classical crystallization.},

abstract = {Calcium phosphate cements are used as bone substitute materials because they may be moulded to fill a void or defect in bone and are osteoconductive. Although apatite cements are stronger than brushite cements, they are potentially less resorbable in vivo. Brushite cements are three-component systems whereby phosphate ions and water react with a soluble calcium phosphate to form brushite (CaHPO4 x 2H2O). Previously reported brushite cement formulations set following the mixture of a calcium phosphate, such as beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), with an acidic component such as H3PO4 or monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM). Due to its low solubility, hydroxyapatite (HA) is yet to be reported as a reactive component in calcium phosphate cement systems. Here we report a new cement system setting to form a matrix consisting predominantly of brushite following the mixture of phosphoric acid with nanocrystalline HA. As a result of the relative ease with which ionic substitutions may be made in apatite this route may offer a novel way to control cement composition or setting characteristics. Since kinetic solubility is dependent on particle size and precipitation temperature is known to affect precipitated HA crystal size, the phase composition and mechanical properties of cements made from HA precipitated at temperatures between 4 and 60 degrees C were investigated.},

Various analytical and spectroscopic techniques including SEM, FT-IR, VSM and DSC were used to characterize the adsorbents prepared in this study. The combined effects of operating parameters such as initial temperature, pH and initial BSA concentration on the adsorption were analyzed using response surface methodology. The optimum conditions were 40°C, pH 4.68, and initial BSA concentration 2.0mg/mL. Desorption experiments were conducted by altering the system temperature where a high recovery rate of protein was obtained. The separation process developed here indicates that the dual-responsive smart adsorbent could be an ideal candidate for the separation of protein.},

abstract = {Stem cell therapies offer great promise for many diseases, especially those without current effective treatments. It is believed that noninvasive imaging techniques, which offer the ability to track the status of cells after transplantation, will expedite progress in this field and help to achieve maximized therapeutic effect. Today's biomedical imaging technology allows for real-time, noninvasive monitoring of grafted stem cells including their biodistribution, migration, survival, and differentiation, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of nanoparticle-labeled cells being one of the most commonly used techniques. Among the advantages of MR cell tracking are its high spatial resolution, no exposure to ionizing radiation, and clinical applicability. In order to track cells by MRI, the cells need to be labeled with magnetic nanoparticles, for which many types exist. There are several cellular labeling techniques available, including simple incubation, use of transfection agents, magnetoelectroporation, and magnetosonoporation. In this overview article, we will review the use of different magnetic nanoparticles and discuss how these particles can be used to track the distribution of transplanted cells in different organ systems. Caveats and limitations inherent to the tracking of nanoparticle-labeled stem cells are also discussed.

abstract = {Textures of calcite crystals from a variety of mineralized tissues belonging to organisms from four phyla were examined with high-resolution synchrotron x-ray radiation. Significant differences in coherence length and angular spread were observed between taxonomic groups. Crystals from polycrystalline skeletal ensembles were more perfect than those that function as single-crystal elements. Different anisotropic effects on crystal texture were observed for sea urchin and mollusk calcite crystals, whereas none was found for the foraminifer, Patellina, and the control calcite crystals. These results show that the manipulation of crystal texture in different organisms is under biological control and that crystal textures in some tissues are adapted to function. A better understanding of this apparently widespread biological phenomenon may provide new insights for improving synthetic crystal-containing materials.},

abstract = {The normal intersurface forces between nanosized probe tips functionalized with COO(-)-terminated alkanethiol self-assembling monolayers and dense, polycrystalline silicon-substituted synthetic hydroxyapatite (SiHA) and phase pure hydroxyapatite (HA) were measured via a nanomechanical technique called chemically specific high-resolution force spectroscopy. A significantly larger van der Waals interaction was observed for the SiHA compared to HA; Hamaker constants (A) were found to be A(SiHA) = 35 +/- 27 zJ and A(HA) = 13 +/- 12 zJ. Using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek approximation, which assumes linear additivity of the electrostatic double layer and van der Waals components, and the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann surface charge model for electrostatic double-layer forces, the surface charge per unit area, sigma (C/m(2)), was calculated as a function of position for specific nanosized areas within individual grains. SiHA was observed to be more negatively charged than HA with sigma(SiHA) = -0.024 +/- 0.013 C/m(2), two times greater than sigma(HA) = -0.011 +/- 0.006 C/m(2). Additionally, SiHA was found to have increased surface adhesion (0.7 +/- 0.3 nN) compared to HA (0.5 +/- 0.3 nN). The characterization of the nanoscale variations in surface forces of SiHA and HA will enable an improved understanding of the initial stages of bone-biomaterial bonding.},

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HAp) powder was treated with gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane (gamma-MPS) using standard techniques in both non-polar and polar systems. Infrared spectra (DRIFT) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the presence of gamma-MPS on the surface of the HAp filler particles. Series of experimental composites consisting of bisphenol-a-glycidyl methacrylate (BisGMA) based resin and untreated or treated HAp filler were produced to determine the mechanical properties and in vitro bioactivity. The incorporation of HAp filler into the BisGMA base resin had an enhancing effect on the flexural strength and Young's modulus of the base resin, the latter being increased by a factor of three. The mechanical properties of the filled resin were not affected by the surface treatment of the HAp, but filler loading was found to have a significant effect on Young's modulus. Higher proportions of silane-treated HAp of smaller particle size could be incorporated in the monomer phase giving rise to composites of higher stiffness. Examination of the fracture surfaces showed that the silanized HAp particles maintained better contact with the polymer matrix. In vitro study revealed that the composites incorporating silanized HAp formed a compact and continuous calcium phosphate layer on their surface after 4 weeks immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF).},

abstract = {Mms6 is a small acidic protein that is tightly associated with bacterial magnetite in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. This protein has previously shown iron binding activity, allowing it to generate uniform magnetic crystals by co-precipitation of ferrous and ferric ions. Here, magnetite crystals were formed by the partial oxidation of ferrous hydroxide in the presence and absence of Mms6. The crystals synthesised were systematically characterised according to their sizes and morphologies using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Mms6-mediated synthesis of magnetite by this methods produced crystals of a uniform size and narrow size distribution with a cubo-octahedral morphology, similar to bacterial magnetite observed in M. magneticum AMB-1. The crystals formed in the absence of Mms6 were octahedral, larger with an increased size distribution. Protein quantification analysis of Mms6 in the synthesised particles indicated tight association of this protein onto the crystal. Furthermore, high affinities to iron ions and a highly charged electrostatic quality suggest that the protein acts as a template for the nucleus formation and/or acts as a growth regulator by recognising crystal faces. The method introduced in this study presents an alternative route for controlling the size and shape of magnetite crystals without the use of organic solvent and high temperatures.},

abstract = {Surface modification with linear polymethacrylic acid (20 kDa), linear and branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa), and branched oligoethylenimine (800 Da) is commonly used to improve the function of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) in many biomedical applications. These polymers were shown herein to have different adsorption capacity and anticipated conformations on the surface of MNPs due to differences in their functional groups, architectures, and molecular weight. This in turn affects the interaction of MNPs surfaces with biological serum proteins (fetal bovine serum). MNPs coated with 25 kDa branched polyethylenimine were found to attract the highest amount of serum protein while MNPs coated with 20 kDa linear polymethacrylic acid adsorbed the least. The type and amount of protein adsorbed, and the surface conformation of the polymer was shown to affect the size stability of the MNPs in a model biological media (RPMI-1640). A moderate reduction in r(2) relaxivity was also observed for MNPs suspended in RPMI-1640 containing serum protein compared to the same particles suspended in water. However, the relaxivities following protein adsorption are still relatively high making the use of these polymer-coated MNPs as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents feasible. This work shows that through judicious selection of functionalization polymers and elucidation of the factors governing the stabilization mechanism, the design of nanoparticles for applications in biologically relevant conditions can be improved.},

The equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were studied. Nanosized magnetic particles (Fe(3)O(4)) were prepared by the chemical precipitation method using Fe2+, Fe3+ salts, and ammonium hydroxide under a nitrogen atmosphere. Characterizations of magnetic particles were carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to confirm the attachment of BSA on magnetic particles. Effects of pH and salt concentrations were investigated on the adsorption process. The experimental results show that the adsorption of BSA on magnetic particles was affected greatly by the pH, while the effect of salt concentrations was insignificant at a low concentration range. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption of BSA on magnetic particles occurred at the isoelectric point of BSA. Adsorption kinetics was analyzed by a linear driving force mass-transfer model. BSA was desorbed from magnetic particles under alkaline conditions, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and FTIR results.},

abstract = {Magnetic compass orientation of migratory birds is known to be light dependent, and radical-pair processes have been identified as the underlying mechanism. Here we report for the first time results of tests with European robins, Erithacus rubecula, in total darkness and, as a control, under 565 nm green light. Under green light, the robins oriented in their normal migratory direction, with southerly headings in autumn and northerly headings in spring. By contrast, in darkness they significantly preferred westerly directions in spring as well as autumn. This failure to show the normal seasonal change characterizes the orientation in total darkness as a "fixed direction" response. Tests in magnetic fields with the vertical or the horizontal component inverted showed that the preferred direction depended on the magnetic field but did not involve the avian inclination compass. A high-frequency field of 1.315 MHz did not affect the behavior, whereas local anesthesia of the upper beak resulted in disorientation. The behavior in darkness is thus fundamentally different from normal compass orientation and relies on another source of magnetic information: It does not involve the radical-pair mechanism but rather originates in the iron-containing receptors in the upper beak.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new cellular automata-based unsupervised image segmentation technique that is motivated by the interactive grow-cut algorithm. In contrast to the traditional method which requires user-interaction to identify classes, the unsupervised grow-cut algorithm (UGC) starts with a random number of seed points and automatically converges to a natural segmentation. This is useful when deriving classes from large image datasets for applications such as region-based image retrieval. The algorithm has been tested on a subset of thirty medical images derived from the Image CLEF med database and 300 natural images from the Berkeley dataset. The unsupervised grow-cut algorithm has been compared against the Mean Shift method and Normalized Cut method. The segmentation outcome of the UGC algorithm is comparable with the other two methods. The number of classes derived by the UGC is independent of the number of initial seed points. Incorporating cellular automata makes the computational complexity of the algorithm independent of the dimension of the image and feature space.},

Here we report the use of small inorganic polyphosphate molecules to template hierarchical intrafibrillar apatite assembly in reconstituted collagen in the presence of polyacrylic acid to sequester calcium and phosphate into transient amorphous nanophases. The use of polyphosphate without a sequestration analogue resulted only in randomly-oriented extrafibrillar precipitations along the fibrillar surface. Conversely, the use of polyacrylic acid without a templating analogue resulted only in non-hierarchical intrafibrillar mineralisation with continuous apatite strands instead of discrete crystallites. The ability of using simple non-protein molecules to recapitulate different levels of structural hierarchy in mineralised collagen signifies the ultimate simplicity in Nature's biomineralisation design principles and challenges the need for using more complex recombinant matrix proteins in bioengineering applications.},

abstract = {Nanoparticle and nanocluster precursors may play a major role in biomineralization. The small differences in enthalpy and free energy among metastable nanoscale phases offer controlled thermodynamic and mechanistic pathways. Clusters and nanoparticles offer concentration and controlled transport of reactants. Control of polymorphism, surface energy, and surface charge on nanoparticles can lead to morphological control and appropriate growth rates of biominerals. Rather than conventional nucleation and growth, assembly of nanoparticles may provide alternative mechanisms for crystal growth. The Ostwald step rule, based on a thermodynamic view of nucleation and growth, is supported by the observation that more metastable phases tend to have lower surface energies. Examples from nonbiological systems, stressing the interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, illustrate features potentially important to biomineralization.},

Both iron deficiency and excess during the early weeks of life can have severe effects on neurodevelopment that may persist into adulthood and may not be corrected by restoration of normal iron levels. This article provides a succinct overview of our current understanding of the extent to which newborns, particularly premature newborns, are able (or not able) to regulate their iron status according to physiologic need. Postnatal development of factors important to iron homeostasis such as intestinal transport, extracellular transport, cellular uptake and storage, intracellular regulation, and systemic control are examined. Also reviewed are how factors peculiar to the sick and premature neonate can further adversely influence iron homeostasis and exacerbate iron-induced oxidative stress, predispose the infant to bacterial infections, and, thus, compromise his or her clinical situation further. The article concludes with a discussion of the areas of relative ignorance that require urgent investigation to rectify our lack of understanding of iron homeostasis in what is a critical stage of development.},

The molecular mechanisms that control nano-sized magnetite crystal formation and the generation of diverse morphologies are not well understood. From the analysis of magnetite crystal-associated proteins, several low molecular mass proteins tightly bound to bacterial magnetite were obtained from Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1. These proteins showed common features in their amino acid sequences, which contain hydrophobic N-terminal and hydrophilic C-terminal regions. The C-terminal regions in Mms5, Mms6, Mms7, and Mms13 contain dense carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that bind iron ions. Nano-sized magnetic particles similar to those in magnetic bacteria were prepared by chemical synthesis of magnetite in the presence of the acidic protein Mms6. These proteins may be directly involved in biological magnetite crystal formation in magnetic bacteria.},

VEGF has also been implicated in pathological angiogenesis associated with tumors, intraocular neovascular disorders and other conditions. The biological effects of VEGF are mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, which differ considerably in signaling properties. Non-signaling co-receptors also modulate VEGF RTK signaling. Currently, several VEGF inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing in several malignancies. VEGF inhibition is also being tested as a strategy for the prevention of angiogenesis, vascular leakage and visual loss in age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {The organization of nanostructures across extended length scales is a key challenge in the design of integrated materials with advanced functions. Current approaches tend to be based on physical methods, such as patterning, rather than the spontaneous chemical assembly and transformation of building blocks across multiple length scales. It should be possible to develop a chemistry of organized matter based on emergent processes in which time- and scale-dependent coupling of interactive components generate higher-order architectures with embedded structure. Herein we highlight how the interplay between aggregation and crystallization can give rise to mesoscale self-assembly and cooperative transformation and reorganization of hybrid inorganic-organic building blocks to produce single-crystal mosaics, nanoparticle arrays, and emergent nanostructures with complex form and hierarchy. We propose that similar mesoscale processes are also relevant to models of matrix-mediated nucleation in biomineralization.},

abstract = {Uniform alpha-Fe2O3 particles within the nanometer range (100-300 nm) have been obtained by precipitation of iron (III) perchlorate in the presence of urea. Different morphology, from spheres to ellipsoidal particles with axial ratio up to approximately 10, was obtained by adding to the initial solution increasing amounts of phosphate anions up to 7 x 10(-3) M. The main targets of this work are the reduction in particle size and precipitation time and the increase of the particles axial ratio, keeping a narrow particle size distribution, in comparison to other methods previously developed to obtain homogenous alpha-Fe2O3 particles. A detailed analysis of the reaction products and a systematic study of the influence of the different precipitation conditions on the characteristics of the resulting particles have been carried out. Finally, some information on the formation mechanism of the ellipsoidal hematite particles in the iron (III) salt-urea-phosphate system is also given. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The optimal concentration at which Si induces cell functions has not been fully elucidated. In the present study the effects of Si concentration (0-6 mM) on the biological functions of MG63 cells were investigated. Cell proliferation in the presence of 2 mM Si- and 4 mM Si-containing media progressively increased with culture time, whereas that of 6mM Si treated MG63 cells was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced. The unusually high Si concentration (6 mM) induced a significant (P{\textless}0.05) increase in the sub-G1 phase of cells from the original 3.60{\%} up to 43.01{\%} after culture for 12 h. In contrast, the other lower Si concentration treated MG63 cells in the sub-G1 phase were in the range 3-5{\%} at all culture time points. 4 mM Si treated MG63 cells, but not 6 mM Si treated MG63 cells, showed remarkably enhanced collagen type I (COL I) gene expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) secretion, which were significantly (P{\textless}0.05) higher than those in the control medium. The activation of ERK was also stimulated in MG63 cells by 4 mM Si. Cells cultured in the presence of 4 mM Si were found to have calcium matrix formation on day 7 that was 15-fold greater than that in the control medium. The results obtained in this study may be useful in designing calcium silicate-based materials with optimal biological properties.},

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HAp) powder was treated with gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane (gamma-MPS) using standard techniques in both non-polar and polar systems. Infrared spectra (DRIFT) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the presence of gamma-MPS on the surface of the HAp filler particles. Series of experimental composites consisting of bisphenol-a-glycidyl methacrylate (BisGMA) based resin and untreated or treated HAp filler were produced to determine the mechanical properties and in vitro bioactivity. The incorporation of HAp filler into the BisGMA base resin had an enhancing effect on the flexural strength and Young's modulus of the base resin, the latter being increased by a factor of three. The mechanical properties of the filled resin were not affected by the surface treatment of the HAp, but filler loading was found to have a significant effect on Young's modulus. Higher proportions of silane-treated HAp of smaller particle size could be incorporated in the monomer phase giving rise to composites of higher stiffness. Examination of the fracture surfaces showed that the silanized HAp particles maintained better contact with the polymer matrix. In vitro study revealed that the composites incorporating silanized HAp formed a compact and continuous calcium phosphate layer on their surface after 4 weeks immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF).},

abstract = {Gelatin is a commonly used natural polymer which is derived from collagen. The isoelectric point of gelatin can be modified during the fabrication process to yield either a negatively charged acidic gelatin, or a positively charged basic gelatin at physiological pH. This theoretically allows electrostatic interactions to take place between a charged biomolecule and gelatin of the opposite charge, forming polyion complexes. Various forms of gelatin carrier matrices can be fabricated for controlled-release studies, and characterization studies have been performed which show that gelatin carriers are able to sorb charged biomolecules such as proteins and plasmid DNA through polyion complexation. The crosslinking density of gelatin hydrogels has been shown to affect their degradation rate in vivo, and the rate of biomolecule release from gelatin carriers has been shown to have a similar profile, suggesting that complexed gelatin/biomolecule fragments are released by enzymatic degradation of the carrier in vivo. This review will emphasize how biomolecules released from gelatin controlled-release systems are able to retain their biological activity, allowing for their use in tissue engineering, therapeutic angiogenesis, gene therapy, and drug delivery applications.},

abstract = {Engineered magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) represent a cutting-edge tool in medicine because they can be simultaneously functionalized and guided by a magnetic field. Use of MNPs has advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), guided drug and gene delivery, magnetic hyperthermia cancer therapy, tissue engineering, cell tracking and bioseparation. Integrative therapeutic and diagnostic (i.e., theragnostic) applications have emerged with MNP use, such as MRI-guided cell replacement therapy or MRI-based imaging of cancer-specific gene delivery. However, mounting evidence suggests that certain properties of nanoparticles (e.g., enhanced reactive area, ability to cross cell and tissue barriers, resistance to biodegradation) amplify their cytotoxic potential relative to molecular or bulk counterparts. Oxidative stress, a 3-tier paradigm of nanotoxicity, manifests in activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (tier I), followed by a proinflammatory response (tier II) and DNA damage leading to cellular apoptosis and mutagenesis (tier III). Invivo administered MNPs are quickly challenged by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), resulting in not only neutralization of potential MNP toxicity but also reduced circulation time necessary for MNP efficacy. We discuss the role of MNP size, composition and surface chemistry in their intracellular uptake, biodistribution, macrophage recognition and cytotoxicity, and review current studies on MNP toxicity, caveats of nanotoxicity assessments and engineering strategies to optimize MNPs for biomedical use.},

We show that the current number of species should grow by between 10 and 20 per cent. There are, however, interesting discrepancies between expert and model estimates for some families, suggesting that our model does not always completely capture patterns of taxonomic activity. The as-yet-unknown species are probably similar to those taxonomists have described recently-overwhelmingly rare and local, and disproportionately in biodiversity hotspots, where there are high levels of habitat destruction.},

abstract = {Mms6 is a dominant protein that tightly associates with the surface of bacterial magnetites in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. The protein has previously been shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystals of cubo-octahedral morphology consisting of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal faces with a narrow size distribution during chemical magnetite synthesis. In order to understand the role of this protein in chemical magnetite synthesis, magnetite formation was investigated using synthetic peptides mimicking the Mms6 protein. Particles that were synthesized in the presence of short peptides harbouring the C-terminal acidic region of Mms6 exhibited a spherical morphology with circularities of 0.70-0.90 similar to those of bacterial magnetites and particles formed in the presence of the Mms6 protein. In contrast, a rectangular morphology with circularities of 0.60-0.85 were obtained when other peptides were used for synthesis. The results indicated that the C-terminal region of the Mms6 protein has significant control over the morphology of magnetite crystals in the chemical synthetic method. This method can, therefore, be useful as an alternative method of controlling the size and morphology of magnetite crystals under ambient conditions.},

SEM observation indicates that the immature coccolith units at the earliest stage were not perfectly fixed on the organic base plates and several units were often lacked. The all units showed platy morphology and often lay parallel to the organic base plate. Their crystal orientations were close to that of the mature R units. With further growth, the platy morphology changes to a trapezoid to anvil-shape for both units, resulting in the interlocking structure of VR units. Morphological analyses present that the edges of the platy crystals parallel to the organic base plate were estimated as [Formula: see text], and their inner/upper surfaces were estimated as [Formula: see text]. As they interlocked further, R units inclined more outward to develop the inner tube elements with [Formula: see text] and then each unit develops differently distal and proximal shield elements, which are respectively estimated as [Formula: see text] in the distal view and [Formula: see text] planes in the proximal view. Based on the above results, the formation of different coccolith units and their growth were discussed.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate forms scales, geological deposits, biominerals, and ocean sediments. Huge amounts of carbon dioxide are retained as carbonate ions, and calcium ions represent a major contribution to water hardness. Despite its relevance, little is known about the precipitation mechanism of calcium carbonate, and specified complex crystal structures challenge the classical view on nucleation considering the formation of metastable ion clusters. We demonstrate that dissolved calcium carbonate in fact contains stable prenucleation ion clusters forming even in undersaturated solution. The cluster formation can be characterized by means of equilibrium thermodynamics, applying a multiple-binding model, which allows for structural preformation. Stable clusters are the relevant species in calcium carbonate nucleation. Such mechanisms may also be important for the crystallization of other minerals.},

abstract = {We report a general thermal transformation approach to synthesize single-crystalline magnetic transition metal oxides nanotubes/nanorings including magnetite Fe(3)O(4), maghematite gamma-Fe(2)O(3), and ferrites MFe(2)O(4) (M = Co, Mn, Ni, Cu) using hematite alpha-Fe(2)O(3) nanotubes/nanorings template. While the straightforward reduction or reduction-oxides process was employed to produce Fe(3)O(4) and gamma-Fe(2)O(3), the alpha-Fe(2)O(3)/M(OH)(2) core/shell nanostructure was used as precursor to prepare MFe(2)O(4) nanotubes via MFe(2)O(4-x) (0 {\textless} x {\textless} 1) intermediate. The transformed ferrites nanocrystals retain the hollow structure and single-crystalline nature of the original templates. However, the crystallographic orientation-relationships of cubic spinel ferrites and trigonal hematite show strong correlation with their morpologies. The hollow-structured MFe(2)O(4) nanocrystals with tunable size, shape, and composition have exhibited unique magnetic properties. Moreover, they have been demonstrated as a highly effective peroxidase mimic catalysts for laboratory immunoassays or as a universal nanocapsules hybridized with luminescent QDs for magnetic separation and optical probe of lung cancer cells, suggesting that these biocompatible magnetic nanotubes/nanorings have great potential in biomedicine and biomagnetic applications.},

abstract = {Magnetosomes are magnetite nanoparticles formed by biomineralization within magnetotactic bacteria. Although there have been numerous genetic and proteomic studies of the magnetosome-formation process, there have been only limited and inconclusive studies of mineral-phase evolution during the formation process, and no real-time studies of such processes have yet been performed. Thus, suggested formation mechanisms still need substantiating with data. Here we report the examination of the magnetosome material throughout the formation process in a real-time in vivo study of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, strain MSR-1. Transmission EM and x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies reveal that full-sized magnetosomes are seen 15 min after formation is initiated. These immature magnetosomes contain a surface layer of the nonmagnetic iron oxide-phase hematite. Mature magnetite is found after another 15 min, concurrent with a dramatic increase in magnetization. This rapid formation result is contrary to previously reported studies and discounts the previously proposed slow, multistep formation mechanisms. Thus, we conclude that the biomineralization of magnetite occurs rapidly in magnetotactic bacteria on a similar time scale to high-temperature chemical precipitation reactions, and we suggest that this finding is caused by a biological catalysis of the process.},

abstract = {Magnetic nanoparticles have been introduced in the cancer arena to optimize the accumulation of the drug dose into the tumor interstitium by means of a magnetic gradient. As a result, the chemotherapeutic agent may exhibit an enhanced anticancer efficacy and a negligible systemic toxicity. In these contexts, we have used the coacervation methodology for the design of magnetite/chitosan (core/shell) nanocomposites. The heterogeneous structure of these multifunctional nanoparticles allows the possibility of their use in drug delivery thanks to their excellent responsiveness to magnetic gradients. A detailed characterization of these nanocomposites (including electron microscopy observations, infrared spectrometry, electrophoresis, and thermodynamic analysis) suggested a complete polymeric coverage of the magnetite nuclei. The magnetic responsiveness of the magnetite/ chitosan nanoparticles was quantitatively investigated by the hysteresis cycle and qualitatively confirmed by microscopic visualization of the performance of the nanocomposite suspensions under exposure to a 1.1 T permanent magnet. This nanodevice has been used to enhance the intravenous delivery of the anticancer agent gemcitabine to the cancer tissue. Compared to the surface adsorption technique, gemcitabine entrapment into the polymeric shell yielded higher drug loading values, and a slower drug release profile. Heating characteristics of the nanocomposites have been investigated in a high frequency alternating magnetic gradient: a stable maximum temperature of 45 C was successfully achieved within 30 min. Finally, an in vivo proof of concept using Prussian blue staining has further confirmed the magnetic targeting capabilities of this magnetite/chitosan core/shell nanodevice. Thus, the here described stimuli-sensitive nanomedicine possesses important characteristics, such as magnetically targeted drug delivery, high drug loading and low burst release, as well as hyperthermia inducing capability, indicating its potential for effective therapy of cancer.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the incorporation of silicon on the surface charge of hydroxyapatite (HA) and to assess surface structural changes of HA and Si-HA induced by dissolution in both static and dynamic systems. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that SiO(4)(4-) groups were substituted for PO(4)(3-) groups in the silicon-hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) lattice according to a previously proposed substitution mechanism without the formation of other crystalline phases, such as tricalcium phosphate or calcium oxide. The substituted silicon induced a decrease in the net surface charge and the isoelectric point of HA as determined by zeta potential (ZP) measurements. At physiological pH=7.4 the surface charge of Si-HA was significantly lowered compared to unmodified HA, i.e. -50+/-5 to -71+/-5 eV, caused by the presence of silicate groups in the HA lattice, which may account for a faster in vitro apatite formation using SBF testing. XPS results indicated that silicon seems to be preferentially leached out from Si-HA surface compared to other ionic species after dissolution studies in tris-buffer using a dynamic system.},

abstract = {There has been an intensive research effort directed at determining the cause of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury over the past decade, but few studies have reported data on the incidence of ACL and other knee ligament injury in the general population. New Zealand's no-fault injury compensation data provides a national injury resource of data on claims for knee ligament injury. The goal of this paper was to provide a descriptive epidemiology of knee ligament injury in this country. Data were obtained for knee ligament injuries between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2005. Injuries were categorised as non-surgical (NS), ACL surgeries (ACLS) and other knee ligament surgeries (OKLS). Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were computed using population estimates. Costs and number of treatment/rehabilitation visits were obtained as an indication of severity. The incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 1147.1 for NS, 36.9 for ACLS and 9.1 for OKLS. Males had a higher incidence rate than females for NS, ACLS, and OKLS. The mean (and median) number of treatment visits were NS: 6.6 (4), ACLS: 27.1 (24), and OKLS: 31.3 (24). The mean (median) treatment costs of these injuries were NS {\$}885 ({\$}129), ACLS {\$}11,157 ({\$}8574), and OKLS {\$}15,663 ({\$}8054). Analysis of injury descriptions for ACLS injuries indicated that 58{\%} involved a non-contact mechanism of injury. These data underscore the high level of short-term disability associated with knee ligament injuries, especially ACL injuries that require surgery.},

abstract = {The modification of surfaces with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) containing multiple different molecules, or containing molecules with multiple different functional components, or both, has become increasingly popular over the last two decades. This explosion of interest is primarily related to the ability to control the modification of interfaces with something approaching molecular level control and to the ability to characterise the molecular constructs by which the surface is modified. Over this time the level of sophistication of molecular constructs, and the level of knowledge related to how to fabricate molecular constructs on surfaces have advanced enormously. This critical review aims to guide researchers interested in modifying surfaces with a high degree of control to the use of organic layers. Highlighted are some of the issues to consider when working with SAMs, as well as some of the lessons learnt (169 references).},

abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for automatic selection of semantically-resonant colors to represent data (e.g., using blue for data about “oceans”, or pink for “love”). Given a set of categorical values and a target color palette, our algorithm matches each data value with a unique color. Values are mapped to colors by collecting representative images, analyzing image color distributions to determine value-color affinity scores, and choosing an optimal assignment. Our affinity score balances the probability of a color with how well it discriminates among data values. A controlled study shows that expert-chosen semantically-resonant colors improve speed on chart reading tasks compared to a standard palette, and that our algorithm selects colors that lead to similar gains. A second study verifies that our algorithm effectively selects colors across a variety of data categories.},

We found that CENS researchers are willing to share their data, but few are asked to do so, and in only a few domain areas do their funders or journals require them to deposit data. Few repositories exist to accept data in CENS research areas.. Data sharing tends to occur only through interpersonal exchanges. CENS researchers obtain data from repositories, and occasionally from registries and individuals, to provide context, calibration, or other forms of background for their studies. Neither CENS researchers nor those who request access to CENS data appear to use external data for primary research questions or for replication of studies. CENS researchers are willing to share data if they receive credit and retain first rights to publish their results.

As revealed in FESEM and TEM analysis, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were self-assembled to chains-like structures, which were coated by carbon shells with thickness of about 150 nm, and the needlelike pine-tree-leaf organization grown perpendicular to the central stems is carbon nanorods. Some important preparative parameters related to the synthesis have been identified and investigated with some designed experiments. Ferromagnetic properties of the carbon-coated Fe3O4 composites with pine-tree-leaf structures have been further differentiated for the different structures, and the results show that the saturation magnetization value (18.4 emu/g) is lower than that of bulk Fe3O4, and the coercivity value (142.3 Oe) is much higher than those of and bulk Fe3O4.},

@article{Erdemir2009,
abstract = {Crystallization is vital to many processes occurring in nature and in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Notably, crystallization is an attractive isolation step for manufacturing because this single process combines both particle formation and purification. Almost all of the products based on fine chemicals, such as dyes, explosives, and photographic materials, require crystallization in their manufacture, and more than 90{\%} of all pharmaceutical products contain bioactive drug substances and excipients in the crystalline solid state. Hence control over the crystallization process allows manufacturers to obtain products with desired and reproducible properties. We judge the quality of a crystalline product based on four main properties: size, purity, morphology, and crystal structure. The pharmaceutical industry in particular requires production of the desired crystal form (polymorph) to assure the bioavailability and stability of the drug substance. In solution crystallization, nucleation plays a decisive role in determining the crystal structure and size distribution. Therefore, understanding the fundamentals of nucleation is crucial to achieve control over these properties. Because of its analytical simplicity, researchers have widely applied classical nucleation theory to solution crystallization. However, a number of differences between theoretical predictions and experimental results suggest that nucleation of solids from solution does not proceed via the classical pathway but follows more complex routes. In this Account, we discuss the shortcomings of classical nucleation theory and review studies contributing to the development of the modern two-step model. In the two-step model that was initially proposed for protein crystallization, a sufficient-sized cluster of solute molecules forms first, followed by reorganization of that cluster into an ordered structure. In recent experimental and theoretical studies, we and other researchers have demonstrated the applicability of the two-step mechanism to both macromolecules and small organic molecules, suggesting that this mechanism may underlie most crystallization processes from solutions. Because we have observed an increase in the organization time of appropriate lattice structures with greater molecular complexity, we propose that organization is the rate-determining step. Further development of a clearer picture of nucleation may help determine the optimum conditions necessary for the effective organization within the clusters. In addition, greater understanding of these processes may lead to the design of auxiliaries that can increase the rate of nucleation and avoid the formation of undesired solid forms, allowing researchers to obtain the final product in a timely and reproducible manner.},

abstract = {Cross-linking of gelatin A and B with N,N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was optimised by varying the NHS/EDC molar ratio at constant EDC concentration. Native and cross-linked gelatin gels were characterised using the degree of swelling, the number of free amine groups, the phase transition temperature, and titration of the carboxylic acid residues. The cross-linking reaction was most efficient at a NHS to EDC molar ratio of 0.2. At higher NHS/EDC molar ratios, the reaction of EDC with NHS becomes more pronounced, thereby reducing the effective amount of EDC for cross-linking. Swelling measurements of cross-linked gelatin gels gave deviating results when no NHS was used, which was explained by heterogeneous localisation of cross-links in the gelatin gel. The incorporation of undesired compounds into the gelatin gels during the cross-linking reaction was not observed. At optimal NHS to EDC molar ratio, gelatin A and B were cross-linked using increasing EDC/COOHgelatin molar ratios. A range of samples varying from very low cross-link density to very high cross-link density (at high EDC/COOHgelatin) was obtained. Stability of the gels is enhanced with increasing cross-link density, but a minimal cross-link density is required to obtain gelatin gels which are stable at 40 degrees C.},

abstract = {Serum-derived granulations and purported nanobacteria (NB) are pleomorphic apatite structures shown to resemble calcium granules widely distributed in nature. They appear to be assembled through a dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism involving proteinaceous factors, as determined by protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and heat inactivation studies. When inoculated into cell culture medium, the purified proteins fetuin-A and albumin fail to induce mineralization, but they will readily combine with exogenously added calcium and phosphate, even in submillimolar amounts, to form complexes that will undergo morphological transitions from nanoparticles to spindles, films, and aggregates. As a mineralization inhibitor, fetuin-A is much more potent than albumin, and it will only seed particles at higher mineral-to-protein concentrations. Both proteins display a bell-shaped, dose-dependent relationship, indicative of the same dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism seen with whole serum. As ascertained by both seeding experiments and gel electrophoresis, fetuin-A is not only more dominant but it appears to compete avidly for nanoparticle binding at the expense of albumin. The nanoparticles formed in the presence of fetuin-A are smaller than their albumin counterparts, and they have a greater tendency to display a multi-layered ring morphology. In comparison, the particles seeded by albumin appear mostly incomplete, with single walls. Chemically, spectroscopically, and morphologically, the protein-mineral particles resemble closely serum granules and NB. These particles are thus seen to undergo an amorphous to crystalline transformation, the kinetics and completeness of which depend on the protein-to-mineral ratios, with low ratios favoring faster conversion to crystals. Our results point to a dual inhibitory-seeding, de-repression model for the assembly of particles in supersaturated solutions like serum. The presence of proteins and other inhibitory factors tend to block apatite nuclei formation or to stabilize the nascent nuclei as amorphous or semi-crystalline spherical nanoparticles, until the same inhibitory influences are overwhelmed or de-repressed, whereby the apatite nuclei grow in size to coalesce into crystalline spindles and films-a mechanism that may explain not only the formation of calcium granules in nature but also normal or ectopic calcification in the body.},

To do this we need to learn more about how energy use is a part of everyday life; this article contributes to that objective. We use the time-geographic diary approach together with interviews to analyze everyday life as a totality. From household members' time diaries, we can analyze and learn about when, where, and what energy-related activities occur in a household context and by whom (and in what social context) they are performed. We discuss the importance of relating information and feedback to households' everyday activities, in order to make it relevant to households. Through our method we discover and visualize activity patterns in a household during a given period. The method is also useful to households as a reflective tool when discussing families' daily lives in relation to energy consumption. The method gives direct feedback to households and the information is relevant since it emanates from their own reported activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wilson2013,
abstract = {Since presenting a paper at the International Digital Curation Conference 2010 conference entitled ‘An Institutional Approach to Developing Research Data Management Infrastructure', the University of Oxford has come a long way in developing research data management (RDM) policy, tools and training to address the various phases of the research data lifecycle. Work has now begun on integrating these various elements into a unified infrastructure for the whole university, under the aegis of the Data Management Roll-out at Oxford (Damaro) Project. This paper will explain the process and motivation behind the project, and describes our vision for the future. It will also introduce the new tools and processes created by the university to tie the individual RDM components together. Chief among these is the ‘DataFinder' – a hierarchically-structured metadata cataloguing system which will enable researchers to search for and locate research datasets hosted in a variety of different datastores from institutional repositories, through Web 2 services, to filing cabinets standing in department offices. DataFinder will be able to pull and associate research metadata from research information databases and data management plans, and is intended to be CERIF compatible. DataFinder is being designed so that it can be deployed at different levels within different contexts, with higher-level instances harvesting information from lower-level instances enabling, for example, an academic department to deploy one instance of DataFinder, which can then be harvested by another at an institutional level, which can then in turn be harvested by another at a national level. The paper will also consider the requirements of embedding tools and training within an institution and address the difficulties of ensuring the sustainability of an RDM infrastructure at a time when funding for such endeavours is limited. Our research shows that researchers (and indeed departments) are at present not exposed to the true costs of their (often suboptimal) data management solutions, whereas when data management services are centrally provided the full costs are visible and off-putting. There is, therefore, the need to sell the benefits of centrally-provided infrastructure to researchers. Furthermore, there is a distinction between training and services that can be most effectively provided at the institutional level, and those which need to be provided at the divisional or departmental level in order to be relevant and applicable to researchers. This is being addressed in principle by Oxford's research data management policy, and in practice by the planning and piloting aspects of the Damaro Project.},

abstract = {Although the mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) is precipitated biochemically by bacteria, protists, and a variety of animals, it has not been documented previously in human tissue. Using an ultrasensitive superconducting magnetometer in a clean-lab environment, we have detected the presence of ferromagnetic material in a variety of tissues from the human brain. Magnetic particle extracts from solubilized brain tissues examined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and elemental analyses identify minerals in the magnetite-maghemite family, with many of the crystal morphologies and structures resembling strongly those precipitated by magnetotactic bacteria and fish. These magnetic and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements imply the presence of a minimum of 5 million single-domain crystals per gram for most tissues in the brain and greater than 100 million crystals per gram for pia and dura. Magnetic property data indicate the crystals are in clumps of between 50 and 100 particles. Biogenic magnetite in the human brain may account for high-field saturation effects observed in the T1 and T2 values of magnetic resonance imaging and, perhaps, for a variety of biological effects of low-frequency magnetic fields.},

The rationale for the approach being taken by Oxford is presented, with particular attention paid to the role of each service division. This is followed by a consideration of the relative advantages and disadvantages of institutional data repositories, as opposed to national or international data centres. The article then focuses on two ongoing JISC-funded projects, ‘Embedding Institutional Data Curation Services in Research' (Eidcsr) and ‘Supporting Data Management Infrastructure for the Humanities' (Sudamih). Both projects are intra-institutional collaborations and involve working with researchers to develop particular aspects of infrastructure, including: University policy, systems for the preservation and documentation of research data, training and support, software tools for the visualisation of large images, and creating and sharing databases via the Web (Database as a Service).},

abstract = {Mms6 is a dominant protein that tightly associates with the surface of bacterial magnetites in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. The protein has previously been shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystals of cubo-octahedral morphology consisting of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal faces with a narrow size distribution during chemical magnetite synthesis. In order to understand the role of this protein in chemical magnetite synthesis, magnetite formation was investigated using synthetic peptides mimicking the Mms6 protein. Particles that were synthesized in the presence of short peptides harbouring the C-terminal acidic region of Mms6 exhibited a spherical morphology with circularities of 0.70-0.90 similar to those of bacterial magnetites and particles formed in the presence of the Mms6 protein. In contrast, a rectangular morphology with circularities of 0.60-0.85 were obtained when other peptides were used for synthesis. The results indicated that the C-terminal region of the Mms6 protein has significant control over the morphology of magnetite crystals in the chemical synthetic method. This method can, therefore, be useful as an alternative method of controlling the size and morphology of magnetite crystals under ambient conditions.},

@phdthesis{Williams2004,
abstract = {In order to enhance the utilization of magnetic nanoparticles in biological systems, it is important to develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions that take place between the two systems. Magnetic nanoparticles are of particular interest for applications such as transfection, biodetection, and targeted drug delivery to name a few. The goal of this research was to study the effect iron oxide nanoparticles have on cellular growth and function, as well as to improve the particles' stability and biocompatibility in aqueous and biological media. Particle synthesis consisted of producing magnetite using the Massart method. Composite iron oxide nanoparticles produced under combustion synthesis were also studied. Previous results indicated that the inorganic nanoparticles formed small aggregates in microbial growth media, thus influencing particle stability. To mitigate this problem, a stabilizing polymer known as gum arabic was tested to control particle size and prevent further agglomeration in aqueous and growth media. Results showed that gum arabic greatly improved particle stability. Growth studies measured the influence of the nanoparticles on cell proliferation using both M9 and Luria Bertani media to track growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in minimal and rich growth conditions. In addition to E. coli, prostate carcinoma cells (cell line DU145) were cultured in the presence of the treated nanoparticles to determine whether gum arabic improved the uptake of the particles in mammalian cells. Fluorescent microscopy was incorporated to detect the location of the nanoparticles in or about the cells by labeling the gum arabic with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The results illustrate the potential use of gum arabic as a surface-modifying agent to improve magnetic particle stability, as well as to promote nanoparticle uptake by mammalian cell cultures.},

abstract = {Adverse effects of viral vectors, instability of naked DNA, cytotoxicity and low transfection of cationic lipids, cationic polymers and other synthetic vectors are currently severe limitations in gene therapy. In addition to targeting a specific cell type, an ideal nonviral vector must manifest an efficient endosomal escape, render sufficient protection of DNA in the cytosol and help provide an easy passage of cytosolic DNA to the nucleus. Virus-like size calcium phosphate nanoparticles have been found to overcome many of these limitations in delivering genes to the nucleus of specific cells. This review has focused on some applications of DNA-loaded calcium phosphate nanoparticles as nonviral vectors in gene delivery, and their potential use in gene therapy, as well as highlighting the mechanistic studies to probe the reason for high transfection efficiency of the vector. It has been demonstrated that calcium ions play an important role in endosomal escape, cytosolic stability and enhanced nuclear uptake of DNA through nuclear pore complexes. The special role of exogenous calcium ions to overcome obstacles in practical realization of this field suggests that calcium phosphate nanoparticles are not 'me too' synthetic vectors and can be designated as second-generation nonviral vectors for gene therapy.},

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HA) powder, porous HA, plasma-sprayed HA, apatite cements, and sintered HA have all been investigated as delivery systems for compounds such as human growth hormone and vancomycin. However, many previous studies showed that the period of release was limited to 2–3 weeks. The concept of using a nanoporous matrix as a means of immobilizing proteins is well known but has largely been confined to silica-based systems. Carbonate hydroxyapatite (CHA) is more soluble in vivo than HA, and when formed as an aqueous precipi- tate, it is often formed as nanocrystals. This study investi- gated the release profiles of ovine albumin (OVA) from CHA gel stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and double distilled water (DDW) for times of up to 1 year. It was found that 7.9{\%} OVA could be loaded onto apatitic gels by means of a purely aqueous process. This process pro- vided a simple low-temperature method of protein adsorp- tion on a high surface area apatitic matrix at physiological pH. The rate of short-term release of OVA was lower from CHAgels than from microcrystallineHApowder. However, the period of release from the CHA gel was short term and may have been associated with recrystallization of the gel. OVA loaded into CHA gel was found to remain undegraded in vitro at 37°C for periods of up to 1 year. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Bioceramic specimens have been prepared by incorporating a small amount of silicon (0.4 wt {\%}) into the structure of hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA] via an aqueous precipitation reaction to produce a silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (Si-HA). The results of chemical analysis confirmed the proposed substitution of the silicon (or silicate) ion for the phosphorus (or phosphate) ion in hydroxyapatite. The Si-HA was produced by first preparing a silicon-substituted apatite (Si-Ap) by a precipitation process. A single-phase Si-HA was obtained by heating/calcining the as-prepared Si-Ap to temperatures above 700 degrees C; no secondary phases, such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP), tetracalcium phosphate (TeCP), or calcium oxide (CaO), were observed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Although the X-ray diffraction patterns of Si-HA and stoichiometric HA appeared to be identical, refinement of the diffraction data revealed some small structural differences between the two materials. The silicon substitution in the HA lattice resulted in a small decrease in the a axis and an increase in the c axis of the unit cell. This substitution also caused a decrease in the number of hydroxyl (OH) groups in the unit cell, which was expected from the proposed substitution mechanism. The incorporation of silicon in the HA lattice resulted in an increase in the distortion of the PO4 tetrahedra, indicated by an increase in the distortion index. Analysis of the Si-HA by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that although the amount of silicon incorporated into the HA lattice was small, silicon substitution appeared to affect the FTIR spectra of HA, in particular the P-O vibrational bands. The results demonstrate that phase-pure silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite may be prepared using a simple precipitation technique.},

abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

Here we review present equilibrium and non-equilibrium self-assembly approaches to the synthetic construction of discrete hybrid (inorganic-organic) nano-objects and higher-level nanostructured networks. We examine a range of synthetic modalities under equilibrium conditions that give rise to integrative self-assembly (supramolecular wrapping, nanoscale incarceration and nanostructure templating) or higher-order self-assembly (programmed/directed aggregation). We contrast these strategies with processes of transformative self-assembly that use self-organizing media, reaction-diffusion systems and coupled mesophases to produce higher-level hybrid structures under non-equilibrium conditions. Key elements of the constructional codes associated with these processes are identified with regard to existing theoretical knowledge, and presented as a heuristic guideline for the rational design of hybrid nano-objects and nanomaterials.},

abstract = {This paper presents simulation studies of nanoparticle supercluster (NPSC) nucleation from a temperature quenched system. The nanoparticles are represented as 5 nm, spherical gold nanoparticles ligated with alkane thiols. The pair potential accounts for the van der Waals interaction between the metallic cores and ligand-ligand and ligand-solvent interactions. Phenomena well-known for molecular systems are observed including a prenucleation induction period, fluctuating prenucleation clusters that predominately add monomers one at a time, a critical nucleus size, and growth of NPSCs from solution in the presence of an equilibrium supernatant, all consistent with classical nucleation theory. However, only the largest prenucleating clusters are dense, and the cluster size can occasionally range greater than the critical size in the prenucleation regime until a cluster with low enough energy occurs, then nucleation ensues. Late in the nucleation process, the clusters display a crystalline structure that is a random mix of face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattices and indistinguishable from a randomized icosahedra structure.},

abstract = {Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

The exchange of ideas, knowledge and data emerging from this research is fundamental for human progress. The rapid development in computing technology and the Internet have opened up new applications for the basic sources of research the base material of research data which has given a major impetus to scientific work in recent years. Databases are rapidly becoming an essential part of the infrastructure of the global science system. The international Human Genome Project is but one good example of a large-scale endeavour in which openly accessible information is being used successfully by many different users, all over the world, for a great variety of purposes. Access to research data increases the returns from public investment in this area; reinforces open scientific inquiry; encourages diversity of studies and opinion; promotes new areas of work and enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators. Science and Technology Ministers called on the OECD in 2004 to develop a set of guidelines based on commonly agreed principles to facilitate cost-effective access to digital research data from public funding. The Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding are the outcome of this request. They are intended to assist all actors involved when trying to improve the international sharing of, and access to, research data.},

abstract = {Proliferation and differentiation of cells are known to be influenced by the physical properties of the extracellular environment. Previous studies examining biophysics underlying cell response to matrix stiffness utilized a two-dimensional (2D) culture format, which is not representative of the three-dimensional (3D) tissue environment in vivo. We report on the effect of 3D matrix modulus on human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC) differentiation. hBMSCs underwent osteogenic differentiation in poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels of all modulus (300-fold modulus range, from 0.2 kPa to 59 kPa) in the absence of osteogenic differentiation supplements. This osteogenic differentiation was modulus-dependent and was enhanced in stiffer gels. Osteogenesis in these matrices required integrin-protein ligation since osteogenesis was inhibited by soluble Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate-Serine peptide, which blocks integrin receptors. Immunostained images revealed lack of well-defined actin filaments and microtubules in the encapsulated cells. Disruption of mechanosensing elements downstream of integrin binding that have been identified from 2D culture such as actin filaments, myosin II contraction, and RhoA kinase did not abrogate hBMSC material-driven osteogenic differentiation in 3D. These data show that increased hydrogel modulus enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in 3D scaffolds but that hBMSCs did not use the same mechanosensing pathways that have been identified in 2D culture.},

abstract = {Silicon-containing hydroxyapatites were synthesized by the controlled crystallization method. Chemical analysis, N(2) adsorption, Hg porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the hydroxyapatite and to monitor the development of a calcium phosphate layer onto the surface of the substrate immersed in a simulated body fluid, that is, in vitro bioactivity tests. The influence of the silicon content and the nature of the starting calcium and phosphorus sources on the in vitro bioactivity of the resulting materials were studied. A sample of silicocarnotite, whose structure is related to that of hydroxyapatite and contains isolated SiO(4) (4-) anions that isomorphically substitute some PO(4) (3-) anions, was prepared and used as reference material for XPS studies. An increase of the unit cell parameters with the Si content was observed, which indicated that SiO(4) (4-) units are present in lattice positions, replacing some PO(4) (3-) groups. By using XPS it was possible to assess the presence of monomeric SiO(4) (4-) units in the surface of apatite samples containing 0.8 wt {\%} of silicon, regardless the nature of the starting raw materials, either Ca(NO(3))(2)/(NH(4))(2)HPO(4)/Si(OCOCH(3))(4) or Ca(OH)(2)/H(3)PO(4)/Si(OCOCH(3))(4). However, an increase of the silicon content up to 1.6 wt {\%} leads to the polymerization of the silicate species at the surface. This technique shows silicon enrichment at the surface of the three samples. The in vitro bioactivity assays showed that the formation of an apatite-like layer onto the surface of silicon-containing substrates is strongly enhanced as compared with pure silicon-free hydroxyapatite. The samples containing monomeric silicate species showed higher in vitro bioactivity than that of silicon-rich sample containing polymeric silicate species. The use of calcium and phosphate salts as precursors lead to materials with higher bioactivity.},

abstract = {Colloidal iron oxides play an important role as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. The superparamagnetic particles actually used are constituted by solid cores (diameter of 5-15 nm), generally coated by a thick polysaccharidic layer (hydrodynamic radii of 30-100 nm), and formulated by direct coprecipitation of iron salts in the presence of polymeric material. To better control the synthesis, we attempted to formulate new stable uncoated superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Colloids were generated by coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of iron salts and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) solution. The influence of parameters such as media composition, iron media, injection fluxes, Fe and TMAOH concentrations, temperature, and oxygen on size, magnetic and magnetic resonance relaxometric properties, and colloidal stability of particles were evaluated. We have determined the relative importance of these parameters as well as the optimal conditions for obtaining uncoated stable particles with an average size of 5 nm and interesting relaxivities. The interpretation of the observed limits takes into account diffusibilities of reactants and product, feeding rates of reactants, and surface properties of nanoparticles. A model of synthesis, related to spontaneous emulsification of suspensions, is proposed. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

The discussion has been generated by excess food production in the EC, continuing public disquiet over the use of chemicals in food production and political agitation. Much of the debate concerns the merits or otherwise of organic agriculture which is often seen by the public as producing food free of chemicals and being more environmentally friendly. This article examines these notions critically dealing with each of the individual claims frequently made for organic agriculture. The article concludes that in the UK, at least, when problems with agriculture emerge they usually hinge around poor management not mode of agriculture. In environmental terms no-till farming currently seems to be better than others. The benefits of holistic thinking by farmers are indicated. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lioliou2007,
abstract = {The precipitation of calcium carbonate as a binding salt for the consolidation of loose sand formations is a promising approach. The heterogeneous nucleation and growth of calcite were investigated in supersaturated solutions. The ionic activities in the solutions tested were selected so that they included both supersaturations in which crystal growth took place only following the introduction of seed particles and supersaturations in which precipitation occurred spontaneously past the lapse of induction times. In the latter case the supersaturation conditions were sufficiently low to allow the measurement of induction times preceding the onset of precipitation. The stability domain of the calcium carbonate system was established at pH 8.50, 25 degrees C, measuring the induction times in the range between 30 min and 2 h. The rates of precipitation following the destabilization of the solutions were measured from the pH and/or concentration-time profiles. The induction times were inversely proportional and rates proportional to the solution supersaturation as expected. The high-order dependence of the rates of precipitation on the solution supersaturation suggested a polynuclear growth mechanism. Fitting of the induction time-supersaturation data according to this model yielded a value of 64 mJ/m2 for the surface energy of the calcite nucleus. In the concentration domain corresponding to stable supersaturated solutions, seeded growth experiments at constant supersaturation showed a second-order dependence on the rates of crystal growth of calcite seed crystals. Inoculation of the stable supersaturated solutions with quartz seed crystals failed to induce nucleation. Raising supersaturation to reach the unstable domain showed interesting features: calcite seed crystals yielded crystal growth kinetics compatible with the polynuclear growth model, without any induction time. The presence of quartz seed crystals reduced the induction times and resulted in nucleation in the bulk solution. The kinetic data in the latter case were consistent with the polynuclear growth model and the surface energy for the newly forming embryo was calculated equal to 31.1 mJ/m2, because of the dominantly heterogeneous nature of the process.},

SEM observation indicates that the immature coccolith units at the earliest stage were not perfectly fixed on the organic base plates and several units were often lacked. The all units showed platy morphology and often lay parallel to the organic base plate. Their crystal orientations were close to that of the mature R units. With further growth, the platy morphology changes to a trapezoid to anvil-shape for both units, resulting in the interlocking structure of VR units. Morphological analyses present that the edges of the platy crystals parallel to the organic base plate were estimated as [Formula: see text], and their inner/upper surfaces were estimated as [Formula: see text]. As they interlocked further, R units inclined more outward to develop the inner tube elements with [Formula: see text] and then each unit develops differently distal and proximal shield elements, which are respectively estimated as [Formula: see text] in the distal view and [Formula: see text] planes in the proximal view.

Various instrumental analyses confirmed the high purity of the phosphonate ester and phosphonic acid terminated alkanethiols. The surface characterization results showed the -PO(3)H(2) terminated SAM was more hydrophilic than the -PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) one. Higher hysteresis values for the -PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) and -PO(3)H(2) terminated SAMs were noted, which were possibly due to the steric hindrance of the bulky terminal groups. In addition, the O(2) plasma + EtOH-rinse pretreated Au sample was hydrophilic because of the residual gold oxide on the surface. This finding was supported by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) as well. The ESCA analysis also indicated bulky and polar terminal groups [-PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) and -PO(3)H(2)] were situated in the outermost layer of its monolayer. The platelet reactivity on the SAM with the nonionic group -PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) was less than those of the ionic terminated SAMs -COOH and -PO(3)H(2).

Our previously published results from homing pigeons have made us suggest that the iron containing sensory dendrites in the inner dermal lining of the upper beak are a candidate structure for such an avian magnetometer system. Here we show that similar structures occur in two species of migratory birds (garden warbler, Sylvia borin and European robin, Erithacus rubecula) and a non-migratory bird, the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus). In all these bird species, histological data have revealed dendrites of similar shape and size, all containing iron minerals within distinct subcellular compartments of nervous terminals of the median branch of the Nervus ophthalmicus. We also used microscopic X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses to identify the involved iron minerals to be almost completely Fe III-oxides. Magnetite (Fe II/III) may also occur in these structures, but not as a major Fe constituent. Our data suggest that this complex dendritic system in the beak is a common feature of birds, and that it may form an essential sensory basis for the evolution of at least certain types of magnetic field guided behavior.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = { Recommendation algorithms are best known for their use on e-commerce Web sites, where they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},

A human osteoblast-like (HOB) cell model was used to study the long-term interaction between the HOB cells and coatings in vitro. Results showed that the number of cells growing on all coated titanium (Ti) samples were statistically significantly higher than on uncoated Ti. In addition, HOB cells growing on all SiHA surfaces displayed enhanced cell spreading, with extensive extracellular matrix synthesis. DNA staining revealed normal phenotype nuclear morphology for HOB cells, with several dense chromosomes surrounded by a periphery of intact nuclear membrane. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining indicated that cells showed improved adhesion on the coated surfaces with increasing Si content, developing mature cytoskeletons with numerous distinct and well-defined actin stress fibres in the cell membranes. Results also demonstrated that the bone mineralisation process was greatest in the presence of the highest Si level (4.9 wt{\%}). However, at very early culturing time point, cells did not attach so readily on the surface of this coating due to rapid dissolution. Thus, this work suggests that a Si content of 2.2 wt{\%} may be the optimum loading to improve the bioactive property of HA thin films.},

We derive the EM algorithm and give an overview of fundamental concepts in graphical models, and inference algorithms on graphs. This is followed by a quick tour of approximate Bayesian inference, including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Laplace approximation, BIC, variational approximations, and expectation propagation (EP).

The method is applied to small nanoparticles of the biomineral calcium carbonate to determine the preferred structure during early stages of crystal growth. For particles 2 nm in diameter, we establish a large energetic preference for amorphous particle morphologies. Particles with partial crystalline order consistent with vaterite are also observed with substantially lower probability. The absence of the stable calcite phase and stability of the amorphous state support recent conjectures that calcite formation starts via the deposition of amorphous calcium carbonate.},

Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during data visualization.},

For 0 {\textless} or = x {\textless} or = 0.5, the sintering rate and grain growth decreased slightly with the amount of silicate. For larger amounts, the sintering behaviour differed with the formation of secondary phases before total densification. Sintering parameters (temperature and time) were adjusted to each composition to produce dense materials having similar microstructure without formation of these secondary phases. Dense ceramics made of pure hydroxyapatite and Si(x)HA containing various amounts of silicate (up to x = 0.6) were biologically tested in vitro with human osteoblast-like cells. The proliferation of cells on the surface of the ceramics increased up to 5 days of culture, indicating that the materials were biocompatible. However, the silicon content did not influence the cell proliferation.},

abstract = {In this review, we highlight particle based crystallization pathways leading to single crystals via mesoscopic transformation. In contrast to the classical mechanism of atom/molecule mediated growth of a single crystal, the particle mediated growth and assembly mechanisms are summarized as "non-classical crystallization", including exiting processes like oriented attachment and mesocrystal formation. Detailed investigations of non-classical crystallization mechanisms are a recent development, but evidence for these pathways is rapidly increasing in the literature. A major driving force for these investigations originates from biomineralization, because it seems that these crystallization routes are frequently applied by natural organisms. We give a non-exhaustive literature survey on these two mechanisms with a focus on recent examples and studies, which are dedicated to a mechanistic understanding. Furthermore, conditions are introduced for which these non-classical crystallization mechanisms can be expected, as they are always an alternative reaction pathway to classical crystallization.},

abstract = {Using data from computer databases of scientific papers in physics, biomedical research, and computer science, we have constructed networks of collaboration between scientists in each of these disciplines. In these networks two scientists are considered connected if they have coauthored one or more papers together. We have studied many statistical properties of our networks, including numbers of papers written by authors, numbers of authors per paper, numbers of collaborators that scientists have, typical distance through the network from one scientist to another, and a variety of measures of connectedness within a network, such as closeness and betweenness. We further argue that simple networks such as these cannot capture the variation in the strength of collaborative ties and propose a measure of this strength based on the number of papers coauthored by pairs of scientists, and the number of other scientists with whom they coauthored those papers. Using a selection of our results, we suggest a variety of possible ways to answer the question "Who is the best connected scientist?"},

abstract = {Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a very powerful technique, which can potentially be used to detect and localize the magnetic fields arising from nanoscopic magnetic domains, such as magnetic nanoparticles. However, in order to achieve this, we must be able to use MFM to discriminate between magnetic forces arising from the magnetic nanoparticles and nonmagnetic forces from other particles and sample features. Unfortunately, MFM can show a significant response even for nonmagnetic nanoparticles, giving rise to potentially misleading results. The literature to date lacks evidence for MFM detection of magnetic nanoparticles with nonmagnetic nanoparticles as a control. In this work, we studied magnetite particles of two sizes and with a silica shell, and compared them to nonmagnetic metallic and silica nanoparticles. We found that even on conducting, grounded substrates, significant electrostatic interaction between atomic force microscopy probes and nanoparticles can be detected, causing nonmagnetic signals that might be mistaken for a true MFM response. Nevertheless, we show that MFM can be used to discriminate between magnetic and nonmagnetic nanoparticles by using an electromagnetic shielding technique or by analysis of the phase shift data. On the basis of our experimental evidence we propose a methodology that enables MFM to be reliably used to study unknown samples containing magnetic nanoparticles, and correctly interpret the data obtained.},

@article{Cleveland1984,
abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

While more and more mesocrystal systems are found in biomineralization or synthesized, their potential as material still needs to be explored. It needs to be revealed, which new chemical and physical properties arise from the mesocrystal structure, or how they change by the ordered aggregation of nanoparticles to fully exploit the promising potential of mesocrystals. Also, the mechanisms for mesocrystal synthesis need to be explored to adapt it to a wide class of materials. The last three years have seen remarkable progress, which is summarized here. Also potential future directions of this reaserch field are discussed. This shows the importance of mesocrystals not only for the field of materials research and allows the appliction of mesocrystals in advanced materials synthesis or property improvement of existing materials. It also outlines attractive research directions in this field.},

Their biological nature has been severely challenged by both geologists and microbiologists, with opinions ranging from considering them crystal structures to new life forms. Although the nature of these autonomously replicating particles is still under debate, their role in several calcification-related diseases has been reported. In order to gain better insights on this calciferous agent, we performed a large-scale project, including the analysis of "nanobacteria" susceptibility to physical and chemical compounds as well as the comprehensive nucleotide, biochemical, proteomic, and antigenic analysis of these particles. Our results definitively ruled out the existence of "nanobacteria" as living organisms and pointed out the paradoxical role of fetuin (an anti-mineralization protein) in the formation of these self-propagating mineral complexes which we propose to call "nanons." The presence of fetuin within renal calculi was also evidenced, suggesting its role as a hydroxyapatite nucleating factor.},

abstract = {Data extracted from microarrays are now considered an important source of knowledge about various diseases. Several studies based on microarray data and the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs have compared supervised machine learning ap- proaches. These comparisons are based on classification schemes in which all samples are classified, regardless of the degree of confidence associated with the classification of a par- ticular sample on the basis of a given classifier. In the domain of healthcare, it is safer to refrain from classifying a sample if the confidence assigned to the classification is not high enough, rather than classifying all samples even if confidence is low. We describe an approach in which the performance of different classifiers is compared, with the possibility of rejection, based on several reject areas. Using a tradeoff between accuracy and rejection, we propose the use of accuracy-rejection curves (ARCs) and three types of relationship between ARCs for comparisons of the ARCs of two classifiers. Empirical results based on purely synthetic data, semi-synthetic data (generated from real data obtained from patients) and public microarray data for binary classification problems demonstrate the efficacy of this method.},

abstract = {The serum protein fetuin-A is a potent systemic inhibitor of soft tissue calcification. Fetuin-A is highly effective in the formation and stabilization of protein-mineral colloids, referred to as calciprotein particles (CPPs). These particles ripen in vitro in a two-step process, indicated by a morphological conversion from spheres to larger prolate ellipsoids. Using a combined light scattering and electron microscopic imaging approach we determined that the second-stage particles resulted from a highly anisotropic outgrowth of the first-stage particles. Electron microscopy of ascites fluid from a patient with calcifying peritonitis revealed particles reminiscent of secondary CPPs. Thus, CPPs form in the body and undergo the two-step ripening at least in pathological conditions. Unlike in vitro generated CPPs, ascites-derived CPPs contained little fetuin-A but large amounts of albumin. This prompted us to study the role of fetuin-A combined with other serum proteins in CPP formation. Fetuin-A was indispensable for primary CPP formation. Albumin and acidic proteins in general greatly enhanced the fetuin-A triggered formation of secondary CPPs and, thus, substituted substantial amounts of fetuin-A without loss of inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation. Thus, direct mineral deposition from solute in the body is unlikely even at low fetuin-A serum levels as long as sufficient bulk acidic protein is available. Collectively fetuin-A and other acidic bulk plasma proteins may be considered as mineral chaperones mediating the stabilization, safe transport, and clearance in the body of calcium and phosphate as colloidal complexes, thus, preventing ectopic calcification.},

The interaction between molecules and surface atoms leads to a strong modification of surface magnetic properties, that are one of the key points in the physics of magnetic nanoparticles. In this paper the magnetic properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (⟨D⟩ ≅ 4− 8 nm) coated with oleic acid have been investigated in order to clarify the role of the molecular coating on the interparticle interactions and surface anisotropy. An increase of magnetic anisotropy (i.e., coercive field and anisotropy constant) with particle size is observed in coated nanoparticles, indicating that the magnetic anisotropy is governed mainly by its magneto- crystalline component. The removal of molecular coating induces a strong increase of anisotropy, because of the increase of its surface component, as indicated by the increase of exchange bias field.},

abstract = {Genetic evidence from mutant mice suggests that alpha(2)-HS glycoprotein/fetuin-A (Ahsg) is a systemic inhibitor of precipitation of basic calcium phosphate preventing unwanted calcification. Using electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, we demonstrate that precipitation inhibition by Ahsg is caused by the transient formation of soluble, colloidal spheres, containing Ahsg, calcium, and phosphate. These "calciprotein particles" of 30-150 nm in diameter are initially amorphous and soluble but turn progressively more crystalline and insoluble in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. Solubilization in Ahsg-containing calciprotein particles provides a novel conceptual framework to explain how insoluble calcium precipitates may be transported and removed in the bodies of mammals. Mutational analysis showed that the basic calcium phosphate precipitation inhibition activity resides in the amino-terminal cystatin-like domain D1 of Ahsg. A structure-function analysis of wild type and mutant forms of cystatin-like domains from Ahsg, full-length fetuin-B, histidine-rich glycoprotein, and kininogen demonstrated that Ahsg domain D1 is most efficient in inhibiting basic calcium phosphate precipitation. The computer-modeled domain structures suggest that a dense array of acidic residues on an extended beta-sheet of the cystatin-like domain Ahsg-D1 mediates efficient inhibition.},

abstract = {Serum-derived granulations and purported nanobacteria (NB) are pleomorphic apatite structures shown to resemble calcium granules widely distributed in nature. They appear to be assembled through a dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism involving proteinaceous factors, as determined by protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and heat inactivation studies. When inoculated into cell culture medium, the purified proteins fetuin-A and albumin fail to induce mineralization, but they will readily combine with exogenously added calcium and phosphate, even in submillimolar amounts, to form complexes that will undergo morphological transitions from nanoparticles to spindles, films, and aggregates. As a mineralization inhibitor, fetuin-A is much more potent than albumin, and it will only seed particles at higher mineral-to-protein concentrations. Both proteins display a bell-shaped, dose-dependent relationship, indicative of the same dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism seen with whole serum. As ascertained by both seeding experiments and gel electrophoresis, fetuin-A is not only more dominant but it appears to compete avidly for nanoparticle binding at the expense of albumin. The nanoparticles formed in the presence of fetuin-A are smaller than their albumin counterparts, and they have a greater tendency to display a multi-layered ring morphology. In comparison, the particles seeded by albumin appear mostly incomplete, with single walls. Chemically, spectroscopically, and morphologically, the protein-mineral particles resemble closely serum granules and NB. These particles are thus seen to undergo an amorphous to crystalline transformation, the kinetics and completeness of which depend on the protein-to-mineral ratios, with low ratios favoring faster conversion to crystals. Our results point to a dual inhibitory-seeding, de-repression model for the assembly of particles in supersaturated solutions like serum. The presence of proteins and other inhibitory factors tend to block apatite nuclei formation or to stabilize the nascent nuclei as amorphous or semi-crystalline spherical nanoparticles, until the same inhibitory influences are overwhelmed or de-repressed, whereby the apatite nuclei grow in size to coalesce into crystalline spindles and films-a mechanism that may explain not only the formation of calcium granules in nature but also normal or ectopic calcification in the body.},

This paper aims at giving voice to children through drawings and their interpretation. The study was conducted in 2009 in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda. Children aged 6-16 years were asked to draw their perceptions of onchocerciasis and community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) in their communities. A total of 50 drawings were generated. The drawings depicted four main aspects of onchocerciasis: (1) the disease symptoms, (2) the negative consequences of onchocerciasis among children and in the community generally, (3) the ivermectin distribution process, and (4) the benefits or effects of taking ivermectin. Out of the 50 drawings, 30 were on symptoms, 7 on effects of the disease on children, 8 on distribution process, and 5 represented multiple perceptions on symptoms, drug distribution processes, benefits, and effects of treatment. The lack of clarity when treatment with ivermectin can be stopped in endemic areas requires working with children to ensure continued compliance with treatment into the future. Children's drawings should be incorporated into health education interventions.},

abstract = {Temporally and spatially controlled delivery of growth factors in polymeric scaffolds is crucial for engineering composite tissue structures, such as osteochondral constructs. In the present study, microsphere-mediated growth factor delivery in polymer scaffolds and its impact on osteochondral differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was evaluated. Two growth factors, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I), were incorporated as a single concentration gradient or reverse gradient combining two factors in the scaffolds. To assess the gradient making system and the delivery efficiency of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and silk fibroin microspheres, initially an alginate gel was fabricated into a cylinder shape with microspheres incorporated as gradients. Compared to PLGA microspheres, silk microspheres were more efficient in delivering rhBMP-2, probably due to sustained release of the growth factor, while less efficient in delivering rhIGF-I, likely due to loading efficiency. The growth factor gradients formed were shallow, inducing non-gradient trends in hMSC osteochondral differentiation. Aqueous-derived silk porous scaffolds were used to incorporate silk microspheres using the same gradient process. Both growth factors formed deep and linear concentration gradients in the scaffold, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After seeding with hMSCs and culturing for 5 weeks in a medium containing osteogenic and chondrogenic components, hMSCs exhibited osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation along the concentration gradients of rhBMP-2 in the single gradient of rhBMP-2 and reverse gradient of rhBMP-2/rhIGF-I, but not the rhIGF-I gradient system, confirming that silk microspheres were more efficient in delivering rhBMP-2 than rhIGF-I for hMSCs osteochondrogenesis. This novel silk microsphere/scaffold system offers a new option for the delivery of multiple growth factors with spatial control in a 3D culture environment for both understanding natural tissue growth process and in vitro engineering complex tissue constructs.},

Time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) and stopped-flow analysis were used to monitor the growth of protein mineral particles nucleating from supersaturated salt solutions. It was found that fetuin-A did not influence the formation of mineral nuclei. However, fetuin-A did prevent the aggregation of nuclei and thus mineral precipitation. Hence, fetuin-A shielded spontaneously formed mineral nuclei, leading to stable calciprotein particles in the first stage of mineralization. Fetuin-A is therefore critically required during the earliest stages of the formation of protein-mineral complexes in order to prevent uncontrolled mineralization.},

abstract = {There has been an intensive research effort directed at determining the cause of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury over the past decade, but few studies have reported data on the incidence of ACL and other knee ligament injury in the general population. New Zealand's no-fault injury compensation data provides a national injury resource of data on claims for knee ligament injury. The goal of this paper was to provide a descriptive epidemiology of knee ligament injury in this country. Data were obtained for knee ligament injuries between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2005. Injuries were categorised as non-surgical (NS), ACL surgeries (ACLS) and other knee ligament surgeries (OKLS). Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were computed using population estimates. Costs and number of treatment/rehabilitation visits were obtained as an indication of severity. The incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 1147.1 for NS, 36.9 for ACLS and 9.1 for OKLS. Males had a higher incidence rate than females for NS, ACLS, and OKLS. The mean (and median) number of treatment visits were NS: 6.6 (4), ACLS: 27.1 (24), and OKLS: 31.3 (24). The mean (median) treatment costs of these injuries were NS {\$}885 ({\$}129), ACLS {\$}11,157 ({\$}8574), and OKLS {\$}15,663 ({\$}8054). Analysis of injury descriptions for ACLS injuries indicated that 58{\%} involved a non-contact mechanism of injury. These data underscore the high level of short-term disability associated with knee ligament injuries, especially ACL injuries that require surgery.},

Huge amounts of carbon dioxide are retained as carbonate ions, and calcium ions represent a major contribution to water hardness. Despite its relevance, little is known about the precipitation mechanism of calcium carbonate, and specified complex crystal structures challenge the classical view on nucleation considering the formation of metastable ion clusters. We demonstrate that dissolved calcium carbonate in fact contains stable prenucleation ion clusters forming even in undersaturated solution. The cluster formation can be characterized by means of equilibrium thermodynamics, applying a multiple-binding model, which allows for structural preformation. Stable clusters are the relevant species in calcium carbonate nucleation. Such mechanisms may also be important for the crystallization of other minerals.},

abstract = {Fetal chondrocytes (FCs) have recently been identified as an alternative cell source for cartilage tissue engineering applications because of their partially chondrogenically differentiated phenotype and developmental plasticity. In this study, chondrocytes derived from fetal bovine cartilage were characterized and then cultured on commercially available Cytodex-1 and Biosilon microcarriers and thermosensitive poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PHEMA-PNIPAAm) beads produced by us. Growth kinetics of FCs were estimated by means of specific growth rate and metabolic activity assay. Cell detachment from thermosensitive microcarriers was induced by cold treatment at 4 °C for 20 min or enzymatic treatment was applied for the detachment of cells from Cytodex-1 and Biosilon. Although attachment efficiency and proliferation of FCs on PHEMA-PNIPAAm beads were lower than that of commercial Cytodex-1 and Biosilon microcarriers, these beads also supported growth of FCs. Detached cells from thermosensitive beads by cold induction exhibited a normal proliferative activity. Our results indicated that Cytodex-1 microcarrier was the most suitable material for the production of FCs in high capacity, however, 'thermosensitive microcarrier model' could be considered as an attractive solution to the process scale up for cartilage tissue engineering by improving surface characteristics of PHEMA-PNIPAAm beads.},

abstract = {The present in vitro study created nanometer crystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) and amorphous calcium phosphate for novel orthopedic applications. Specifically, nano-crystalline HA and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles were synthesized by a wet chemical process followed by hydrothermal treatment for 2 hours at 200 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively. Resulting particles were then pressed into compacts. For the preparation of control conventional HA particles (or those currently used in orthopedics with micron diameters), the aforementioned calcium phosphate particles were pressed into compacts and sintered at 1100 degrees C for 2 hours. All calcium phosphate-based particles were fully characterized. Results showed that although there was an initial weight gain for all the compacts studied in this experiment, higher eventual degradation rates up to 3 weeks were observed for nano-amorphous calcium phosphate compared with nano-crystalline HA which was higher than conventional HA. Peptide functionalization (with the cell adhesive peptide lysine-arginine-serine-arginine [KRSR] and the non-cell-adhesive peptide lysine-serine-arginine-arginine [KSRR]) was accomplished by means of a three-step reaction procedure: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), cross-linking with N-succinimidyl-3-maleimido propionate (SMP), and finally peptide immobilization. The peptide functionalization was fully characterized. Results demonstrated increased osteoblast (bone-forming cell) adhesion on non-functionalized and functionalized nano-crystalline HA compacts compared with nano amorphous calcium phosphate compacts; both increased osteoblast adhesion compared with conventional HA. To further exemplify the novel properties of nano crystalline HA, results also showed similar osteoblast adhesion between non-functionalized nano crystalline HA and KRSR functionalized conventional HA. Thus, results provided evidence that nanocrystalline HA should be further studied for orthopedic applications.},

abstract = {A low efficiency has long been the most critical problem of conventional gene-transferring systems using calcium phosphates, and this was successfully improved on by using a laminin-DNA-apatite composite (LD-Ap) layer. The gene-transferring efficiency of the LD-Ap surface was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a DNA-calcium phosphate composite surface. This is because laminin enhances cell adhesion and spreading, and this provides regions of high DNA concentration between a cell and the LD-Ap surface. The efficiency of gene transfer of the LD-Ap surface was equivalent to, or even higher than that mediated using a commercial lipid-based transfection reagent applied using the manufacturer's recommended optimum conditions. In addition, the gene-transferring efficiency of our system could be controlled by changing the laminin and DNA content in the LD-Ap layer. Moreover, our system is composed of highly safe reagents: apatite, DNA and laminin, all of which are present in the human body. Hence, the LD-Ap surface, which enhances cell attachment on its surface, and mediates a safe, highly efficient and controllable gene transfer, is highly applicable to tissue engineering and gene therapy applications.},

Well-dispersed CPNPs encapsulating Cy3 amidite exhibited nearly a 5-fold increase in fluorescence quantum yield when compared to the free dye in PBS. FCS diffusion data and cell staining were used to show pH-dependent dissolution of the particles and cellular uptake, respectively. Furthermore, an experimental hydrophobic cell growth inhibitor, ceramide, was successfully delivered in vitro to human vascular smooth muscle cells via encapsulation in CPNPs. These studies demonstrate that CPNPs are effective carriers of dyes and drugs for bioimaging and, potentially, for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have analyzed magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals acid-extracted from carbonate globules in Martian meteorite ALH84001. We studied 594 magnetites from ALH84001 and grouped them into three populations on the basis of morphology: 389 were irregularly shaped, 164 were elongated prisms, and 41 were whisker-like. As a possible terrestrial analog for the ALH84001 elongated prisms, we compared these magnetites with those produced by the terrestrial magnetotactic bacteria strain MV-1. By TEM again, we examined 206 magnetites recovered from strain MV-1 cells. Natural (Darwinian) selection in terrestrial magnetotactic bacteria appears to have resulted in the formation of intracellular magnetite crystals having the physical and chemical properties that optimize their magnetic moment. In this study, we describe six properties of magnetite produced by biologically controlled mechanisms (e.g., magnetotactic bacteria), properties that, collectively, are not observed in any known population of inorganic magnetites. These criteria can be used to distinguish one of the modes of origin for magnetites from samples with complex or unknown histories. Of the ALH84001 magnetites that we have examined, the elongated prismatic magnetite particles (similar to 27{\%} of the total) are indistinguishable from the MV-1 magnetites in five of these six characteristics observed for biogenically controlled mineralization of magnetite crystals.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of combined (double contrast) use of superparamagnetic iron particles (SPIOs) and gadolinium (Gd) in liver MR imaging. Material and Methods: Unenhanced, Gd-enhanced, SPIO-enhanced, and both SPIO- and Gd-enhanced images were acquired at 1.5 T. Twenty patients with previously detected liver lesions were included. Fast SE-STIR, and breath-hold true FISP, fat-suppressed T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained with all techniques. Lesion count was assessed by consensus reading. Results: Collective evaluation of all MR sequences revealed 61 lesions in 16 patients; SPIO-enhanced MR detected lesions with a sensitivity of 95{\%} (n=58). The sensitivity of unenhanced MR imaging was 90{\%} (n=55). There was no statistical difference between SPIO-enhanced and unenhanced MR images. From single sequences, the greatest number of lesions was detected with the SPIO-enhanced fast SE-STIR sequence (n=56, sensitivity 92{\%}). By using the fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequence, Gd-enhanced and both SPIO- and Gd-enhanced MR images demonstrated sensitivities of 77{\%} (n=47) and 80{\%} (n=49), respectively. Despite the combined use of both contrast media, this sequence was significantly less sensitive in lesion detection when compared to SPIO-enhanced imaging. Conclusion: SPIO-enhanced MR imaging was the most sensitive method in lesion detection. The benefit of the combined use of SPIO and Gd was negligible.},

abstract = {Bone is a composite material in which collagen fibrils form a scaffold for a highly organized arrangement of uniaxially oriented apatite crystals1,2. In the periodic 67nm cross- striated pattern of the collagen fibril3–5, the less dense 40- nm-long gap zone has been implicated as the place where apatite crystals nucleate from an amorphous phase, and subsequently grow6–9. This process is believed to be directed by highly acidic non-collagenous proteins6,7,9–11; however, the role of the collagen matrix12–14 during bone apatite mineralization remains unknown. Here, combining nanometre- scale resolution cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and cryogenic electron tomography15 with molecular modelling, we show that collagen functions in synergy with inhibitors of hydroxyapatite nucleation to actively control mineralization. The positive net charge close to the C-terminal end of the collagen molecules promotes the infiltration of the fibrils with amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). Furthermore, the clusters of charged amino acids, both in gap and overlap regions, formnucleation sites controlling the conversion ofACP into a parallel array of oriented apatite crystals.We developed a model describing the mechanisms through which the structure, supramolecular assembly and charge distribution of collagen can control mineralization in the presence of inhibitors of hydroxyapatite nucleation.},

Particle diameter can be tuned from 3 to 20 nm by varying reaction conditions or by seed-mediated growth. The as-synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles have a cubic spinel structure as characterized by HRTEM, SAED, and XRD. Further, Fe(3)O(4) can be oxidized to Fe(2)O(3), as evidenced by XRD, NEXAFS spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. The hydrophobic nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrophilic ones by adding bipolar surfactants, and aqueous nanoparticle dispersion is readily made. These iron oxide nanoparticles and their dispersions in various media have great potential in magnetic nanodevice and biomagnetic applications.},

One perspective is found in the work of physicists and mathematicians who formally introduced the small world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment. The other perspective is sociological and focuses on the process of cumulative advantage and considers the agency of individual actors in a network. We test hypotheses, based on work drawn from these perspectives, regarding the structure and dynamics of scientific collaboration networks. The data we use are for four scientific disciplines in the Slovene system of science. The results deal with the overall topology of these networks and specific processes that generate them. The two perspectives can be joined to mutual benefit. Within this combined approach, the presence of small-world structures was confirmed. However preferential attachment is far more complex than advocates of a single autono- mous mechanism claim. Keywords},

The optimum conditions were 40°C, pH 4.68, and initial BSA concentration 2.0mg/mL. Desorption experiments were conducted by altering the system temperature where a high recovery rate of protein was obtained.

abstract = {"Nanobacteria" are nanometer-scale spherical and ovoid particles which have spurred one of the biggest controversies in modern microbiology. Their biological nature has been severely challenged by both geologists and microbiologists, with opinions ranging from considering them crystal structures to new life forms. Although the nature of these autonomously replicating particles is still under debate, their role in several calcification-related diseases has been reported. In order to gain better insights on this calciferous agent, we performed a large-scale project, including the analysis of "nanobacteria" susceptibility to physical and chemical compounds as well as the comprehensive nucleotide, biochemical, proteomic, and antigenic analysis of these particles. Our results definitively ruled out the existence of "nanobacteria" as living organisms and pointed out the paradoxical role of fetuin (an anti-mineralization protein) in the formation of these self-propagating mineral complexes which we propose to call "nanons." The presence of fetuin within renal calculi was also evidenced, suggesting its role as a hydroxyapatite nucleating factor.},

abstract = {Abnormal interactions and misfolding of synaptic proteins in the nervous system are being extensively explored as important pathogenic events resulting in neurodegeneration in various neurological disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In AD, misfolded amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, accumulates in the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum and extracellularly as plaques. In contrast, in PD and DLB cases there is abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies, axons, and synapses. Furthermore, in DLB, Abeta 1-42 may promote alpha-synuclein accumulation and neurodegeneration. The central event leading to synaptic and neuronal loss in these diseases is not completely clear yet; however, recent advances in the field suggest that nerve damage might result from the conversion of nontoxic monomers to toxic oligomers and protofibrils. The mechanisms by which misfolded Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might lead to synapse loss are currently under investigation. Several lines of evidence support the possibility that Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might interact to cause mitochondrial and plasma membrane damage upon translocation of protofibrils to the membranes. Accumulation of Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane might result in the release of cytochrome C with the subsequent activation of the apoptosis cascade. Conversely, the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with AD and PD may also lead to increased membrane permeability and cytochrome C release, which promotes Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomerization and neurodegeneration. Together, these studies suggest that the translocation of misfolded proteins to the mitochondrial membrane might play an important role in either triggering or perpetuating neurodegeneration. The insights obtained from the characterization of this process may be applied to the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in other neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. New evidence may also provide a rationale for the mitochondrial membrane as a target for therapy in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Silane coupling agents have been the focus of the research. In this study, an effective surface modification method was developed using hexamethylene diisocyanate as a coupling agent. Polyethylene glycol (Mw = 1500) was successfully coupled to the surface of nano-size apatite particles (nano-apatite). Various methods were used to characterize the surface-modified nano-apatite. Infra-red spectra confirmed the existence of a layer of polymer with both urethane and ether linkage on the surface of nano-apatite. The amount of grafted polymer as determined by total organic carbon analysis (TOC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was about 20{\%} in weight. Solid 1H MAS NMR spectra indicated that the amount of hydroxyl groups of nano-apatite was decreased by 7.7{\%} after surface grafting reaction. It is concluded that the surface hydroxyl groups of nano-apatite have the reactivity towards isocyanate groups.},

The equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were studied. Nanosized magnetic particles (Fe(3)O(4)) were prepared by the chemical precipitation method using Fe2+, Fe3+ salts, and ammonium hydroxide under a nitrogen atmosphere. Characterizations of magnetic particles were carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to confirm the attachment of BSA on magnetic particles. Effects of pH and salt concentrations were investigated on the adsorption process. The experimental results show that the adsorption of BSA on magnetic particles was affected greatly by the pH, while the effect of salt concentrations was insignificant at a low concentration range. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption of BSA on magnetic particles occurred at the isoelectric point of BSA. Adsorption kinetics was analyzed by a linear driving force mass-transfer model. BSA was desorbed from magnetic particles under alkaline conditions, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and FTIR results.},

@article{Jia2008,
abstract = {We present an innovative approach to the production of single-crystal iron oxide nanorings employing a solution-based route. Single-crystal hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorings were synthesized using a double anion-assisted hydrothermal method (involving phosphate and sulfate ions), which can be divided into two stages: (1) formation of capsule-shaped alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and (2) preferential dissolution along the long dimension of the elongated nanoparticles (the c axis of alpha-Fe2O3) to form nanorings. The shape of the nanorings is mainly regulated by the adsorption of phosphate ions on faces parallel to c axis of alpha-Fe2O3 during the nanocrystal growth, and the hollow structure is given by the preferential dissolution of the alpha-Fe2O3 along the c axis due to the strong coordination of the sulfate ions. By varying the ratios of phosphate and sulfate ions to ferric ions, we were able to control the size, morphology, and surface architecture to produce a variety of three-dimensional hollow nanostructures. These can then be converted to magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) by a reduction or reduction-oxidation process while preserving the same morphology. The structures and magnetic properties of these single-crystal alpha-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and gamma-Fe2O3 nanorings were characterized by various analytical techniques. Employing off-axis electron holography, we observed the classical single-vortex magnetic state in the thin magnetite nanorings, while the thicker rings displayed an intriguing three-dimensional magnetic configuration. This work provides an easily scaled-up method for preparing tailor-made iron oxide nanorings that could meet the demands of a variety of applications ranging from medicine to magnetoelectronics.},

abstract = {A promising strategy to promote angiogenesis within an engineered tissue is the local and sustained delivery of an angiogenic factor by the substitute itself. Recently, we reported on functionalization of Biocement D (BioD) and several modifications of this calcium phosphate bone cement with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Maintenance of biological activity of VEGF after release from the cement was improved by modification of BioD with mineralized collagen type I (BioD/coll). However, BioD/coll composites showed a higher initial burst of VEGF release than do the unmodified BioD. In the present study, VEGF release from BioD/coll composites modified with different amounts of heparin was investigated. We found a distinct reduction of the initial burst of release by adding heparin in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the heparin modification had a positive impact on the biological activity of released VEGF. An advancement of biological properties of BioD/coll by addition of heparin was further shown by improved adhesion of endothelial cells on the cement surface. Characterization of material properties of the heparin-modified BioD/coll composites revealed a finer microstructure with smaller HA-particles and a higher specific surface area than heparin-free BioD/coll. However, higher amounts of heparin resulted in a reduced compressive strength. The rheological properties of these cement pastes have been found to be favorable for good handling particularly with regard to their clinical application.},

abstract = {This dissertation reports the design of a process (patent pending) to remove iron from acid mine drainage (AMD) without the formation of metal hydroxide sludge. The system includes the oxidation of ferrous iron in a packed bed bioreactor, the precipitation of iron within a fluidized bed, the removal of manganese and heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) in a trickling filter at high ({\textgreater}9) pH, with final neutralization in a carbonate bed. The technique avoided the generation of iron oxyhydroxide sludge. In the packed bed bioreactor, maximum substrate oxidation rate (R,max) was 1500 mg L -1 h -1 at dilution rates of 2 h -1 , with oxidation efficiency at 98{\%}. The half-saturation constant (similar to a Ks ) was 6 mg L -1 . The oxidation rate was affected by dissolved oxygen below 2 mg L -1 , with a Monod-type Ko for DO of 0.33 mg L -1 . Temperature had a significant effect on oxidation rate, but pH (2.0 to 3.25) and supplemental CO2 did not affect oxidation rates. Iron hydroxide precipitation was not instantaneous when base was added at a OH/Fe ratio of less than 3. Induction time was found to be a function of pH, sulfate concentration and iron concentration, with a multiple R 2 of 0.84. Aqueous [Al (III)] and [Mn (II)] did not significantly ($\alpha$ = 0.05) affect induction time over the range of concentrations investigated. When specific loading to the fluidized bed reactor exceeded 0.20 mg Fe m -2 h -1 , dispersed iron particulates formed leading to a turbid effluent. Reactor pH determined the minimum iron concentration in the effluent, with an optimal at pH 3.5. Total iron removals of 98{\%} were achieved in the fluidized bed with effluent [Fe] below 10 mg L -1 . Further iron removal occurred within the calcium carbonate bed. Heavy metals were removed both in the fluidized bed reactor as well as in the trickling filter. Oxidation at pH {\textgreater}9 caused manganese to precipitate (96{\%} removal); removals of copper, nickel, and zinc were due primarily to sorption onto oxide surfaces. Removals averaged 97{\%} for copper, 70{\%} for nickel and 94{\%} for zinc. The treatment strategy produced an effluent relatively free of iron ({\textless} 3 mg/L), without the formation of iron sludge and may be suitable for AMD seeps, drainage from acidic tailings ponds, active mine effluent, and acidic iron-rich industrial wastewater},

In order to use HA as injectable nanoparticles that can be directed at will to various locations in the body to treat bone defects, HA was coated onto iron oxide nanoparticles in this study. Specifically, magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles were synthesized and coated with HA. The resulting nanoparticles were treated hydrothermally to control the crystalline properties of the coating. Nanoparticles were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, Ζeta potential and vibrating sample magnetometry. Nanoparticle uptake by osteoblasts was studied using TEM. Osteoblast density was measured after 1, 3 and 5days in the presence of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles alone and HA-coated Fe(3)O(4) magnetic nanoparticles. Long-term osteoblast experiments demonstrated greater alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein synthesis, collagen synthesis and calcium deposition after 7, 14 and 21days in the presence of greater concentrations (up to 200$\mu$gml(-1)) of HA-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. In summary, the results of this study showed that HA-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles should be further studied for various orthopedic applications in which such particles could be injected, their location controlled using an external magnetic source and bone growth promoted.},

The superparamagnetic particles actually used are constituted by solid cores (diameter of 5-15 nm), generally coated by a thick polysaccharidic layer (hydrodynamic radii of 30-100 nm), and formulated by direct coprecipitation of iron salts in the presence of polymeric material. To better control the synthesis, we attempted to formulate new stable uncoated superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Colloids were generated by coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of iron salts and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) solution. The influence of parameters such as media composition, iron media, injection fluxes, Fe and TMAOH concentrations, temperature, and oxygen on size, magnetic and magnetic resonance relaxometric properties, and colloidal stability of particles were evaluated. We have determined the relative importance of these parameters as well as the optimal conditions for obtaining uncoated stable particles with an average size of 5 nm and interesting relaxivities. The interpretation of the observed limits takes into account diffusibilities of reactants and product, feeding rates of reactants, and surface properties of nanoparticles.

abstract = {Data extracted from microarray chips are considered to be an important source for providing insight about different diseases. Several studies (including ROC graphs) based on microarray data have been reported for comparison of supervised machine learning approaches. These comparisons rely on the classification schemes where all the samples are discriminated no matter how much the classifier is confident on classification. In health care domain, it is better to abstain when the confidence on classification is not sufficiently high enough instead of classifying all examples with pretty low confidence. In our approach, we proposed to compare the classifiers' performance in the scenario of reject option by considering different reject areas. Based on Accuracy-Rejection tradeoff we proposed four types of Accuracy-Rejection Curves (ARCs). Empirical results based on pure artificial data and data synthesized from real patients' data for binary classification problem depict the efficacy of proposed comparison.},

The model is based on a size-dependent growth rate expression incorporating the Gibbs−Thomson relationship between particle size and solubility, and is solved numerically. The effect of parameters such as average initial particle size, initial width of the particle size distribution, and initial mass as well as solubility are investigated in simulations. This analysis focuses on understanding how the ripening phenomenon can be exploited in a crystallization process. The simulations are compared to the predictions of classical Lifshitz, Slyozov, Wagner (LSW) theory. Using our results, we assess the advantages and disadvantages of the full numerical simulation compared to the LSW model.},

Similarly, reaction of Fe(acac)(3) and Co(acac)(2) or Mn(acac)(2) with the same diol results in monodisperse CoFe(2)O(4) or MnFe(2)O(4) nanoparticles. Particle diameter can be tuned from 3 to 20 nm by varying reaction conditions or by seed-mediated growth. The as-synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles have a cubic spinel structure as characterized by HRTEM, SAED, and XRD. Further, Fe(3)O(4) can be oxidized to Fe(2)O(3), as evidenced by XRD, NEXAFS spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. The hydrophobic nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrophilic ones by adding bipolar surfactants, and aqueous nanoparticle dispersion is readily made. These iron oxide nanoparticles and their dispersions in various media have great potential in magnetic nanodevice and biomagnetic applications.},

abstract = {Positively charged Hap nano-crystals were prepared by using beta-alanine and clarified the adsorption affinity of these surface amide functionalized Hap nano-crystals to proteins. Colloidal surface amide functionalized Hap nano-crystals were prepared by wet method in the presence of various amounts of beta-alanine by changing molar ratio of beta-alanine/Ca (beta/Ca ratio) in the solution. The rod-like nano-crystals were lengthened with addition of beta-alanine though their width did not vary; carboxyl groups of beta-alanine are strongly coordinated to Ca2+ ions exposed on ac and/or bc faces to inhibit particle growth to a- and/or b-axis directions and enhance the particle growth along to the c-axis. No difference can be recognized on the crystal structure among the synthesized Hap nano-crystals by XRD measurements. However, the large difference was recognized by TG-DTA and FTIR measurements. Those measurements revealed that beta-alanine is incorporated on the Hap nano-crystal surface up to the beta/Ca ratio of 1.0, though they are absent in the nano-crystals synthesized at beta/Ca ratio {\textgreater} or = 2.0. The zeta potential (zp) of beta-alanine-Hap nano-crystals prepared at beta/Ca = 0.4 and 1.0 of those incorporating beta-alanine exhibited positive charge at pH {\textless} or = 5.9. The saturated amounts of adsorbed BSA for the positively charged beta-alanine-Hap nano-crystals were increased 2.3-2.4-fold by their electrostatic attraction force between positively charged beta-alanine-Hap nano-crystals and negatively charged BSA molecules. We were able to control the adsorption affinity of Hap nano-crystal by changing their surface charge.},

abstract = {Phase pure hydroxyapatite (HA) and two silicate-substituted hydroxyapatites (0.8 and 1.5 wt{\%} Si, or 2.6 and 4.9 wt{\%} SiO4) were prepared by aqueous precipitation methods. The filter-cakes of HA and silicate-substituted hydroxyapatite (SiHA) compositions were processed into granules 1.0-2.0 mm in diameter and sintered at 1200 degrees C for 2 h. The sintered granules underwent full structural characterisation, prior to assessment in an ovine defect model by implantation for a period of 6 and 12 weeks. The results indicate that HA and SiHA implants were well accepted by the host tissue, with no evidence of inflammation. New bone formation was observed directly on the surfaces and in the spaces between the granular implants. Quantitative histomorphometry as determined by the percentage of bone ingrowth and bone coverage for both SiHA implant compositions was significantly greater than that for phase pure HA. These findings indicate that the in vivo bioactivity of hydroxyapatite was significantly improved by the incorporation of silicate ions into the HA structure, making SiHA ceramics attractive alternatives to conventional HA materials for use as bone graft substitute ceramics.},

Thereby, the expression of enhanced green fluorescing protein (EGFP) can be induced (by using pcDNA3-EGFP) or silenced (by using siRNA). The single-shell nanoparticles were prepared by rapid mixing of aqueous solutions of calcium nitrate and diammonium hydrogen phosphate. The multi-shell nanoparticles were produced by adding further layers of calcium phosphate and DNA to protect DNA from the intracellular degradation by endonucleases. The size of the nanoparticles according to dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy was up to 100 nm with a zeta potential around -30 mV. The transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles was tested in vitro in cell culture.},

@article{Piwowar2013,
abstract = {Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the "citation benefit". Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 5{\%} to 13{\%}) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30{\%}. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20{\%} of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},

abstract = {In our earlier study, we showed that the surface hydroxyl groups of hydroxyapatite have the ability to react with organic isocyanate groups. In this study, the feasibility of grafting poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA), and Poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [poly(HEMA)] by using the reaction of isocyanate groups with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of HA was investigated. Double bonds were introduced to the surface of HA via the coupling reaction of isocyanateoethyl methacrylate (ICEM) with HA, or through hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and HA, followed by radical polymerization in MMA, BMA, or HEMA. Infrared spectra indicated the existence of polymers on the surfaces of HA. Thermogravimetric analysis also confirmed the presence of grafted polymers on the surface of HA powder particles (20-26 wt{\%}). The polymers gave typical PMMA, PBMA, or poly(HEMA) infrared spectra, with the exception of amide bands, a result of the coupling reaction of ICEM or HMDI with hydroxy groups of HA or HEMA. Therefore it is concluded that the polymers were chemically bonded to the surface of HA through the isocyanate groups of ICEM or HMDI.},

The plasma protein fetuin-A inhibits calcium phosphate deposition by forming colloidal calciprotein particles (CPPs). In this article the authors present a detailed small angle neutron scattering study including contrast variation analysis providing detailed quantitative information on the three-dimensional topology of the CPPs and on their morphogenesis. In detail the authors found the following: (i) A two stage growth process showing spontaneously formed primary particles with a size of about 500 A diameter that subsequently transformed to 1000 A sized particles which were stable for at least 24 h. (ii) A particular shielding topology was observed for the second CPP state, namely, that a densely packed fetuin-A monolayer covers a mineral core and thereby prevents further crystal growth. (iii) Transmission electron microscopy analysis of in vitro synthesized second state CPPs revealed striking similarities to material retrieved from a human peritonitis patient. This latter finding underscores the importance of short- and long-term stabilizations of CPPs by fetuin-A to enable clearing of mineral debris in the body.},

abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

The average hydrodynamic diameter of the MNPs was 89.2 ± 8.5 nm and all the MNPs displayed superparamagnetic properties. A maximum effective dose of 379.34 $\mu$g BCNU could be immobilized on 1 mg of MNP-3 (bound-BCNU-3). Bound-BCNU-3 was more stable than free-BCNU when stored at 4 °C, 25 °C or 37 °C. Bound-BCNU-3 could be concentrated at targeted sites in vitro and in vivo using an externally applied magnet. When applied to brain tumors, magnetic targeting increased the concentration and retention of bound-BCNU-3. This drug delivery system promises to provide more effective tumor treatment using lower therapeutic doses and potentially reducing the side effects of chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Tailoring the structure of nanocrystal superlattices is an important step toward controlled design of novel nanostructured materials and devices. We demonstrate how the long-range order and macroscopic dimensions of magnetic nanoparticle arrays can be controlled by the use of a modulated magnetic field. Inducing a dipolar attraction during the initial stage of the drying-mediated self-assembly process was sufficient to assemble the superparamagnetic oleate-capped maghemite nanocubes into large and defect-free superstructures with both translational and orientational order. The characteristic dimensions of the superlattice are controlled by the particle concentration as well as the duration of the applied magnetic field. The superparamagnetic maghemite nanocubes assemble into large and highly oriented thin arrays by applying the magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate surface only during the initial phase of drying-mediated self-assembly. Micrometer-sized and thick three-dimensional mesocrystals are obtained when the drying dispersion is subjected to an external magnetic field of moderate strength for the entire duration of the assembly process. The discovery of how translational and orientation order of nanocrystal superlattices can be induced by a temporal modulation of an anisotropic interparticle force offers new insight on the importance of the initial nucleation stage in the self-assembly process and suggests new routes for controlled self-assembly of dipolar nanocrystals.},

The process is iterative, as the automaton labels the image, user can observe the segmentation evolution and guide the algorithm with human input where the seg- mentation is difficult to compute. In the areas, where the segmen- tation is reliably computed automatically no additional user effort is required. Results of segmenting generic photos and medical im- ages are presented. Our experiments show that modest user effort is required for segmentation of moderately hard images.},

abstract = {Mineralization of calcium carbonate in aqueous solutions starting from its initiation was studied by time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). SANS revealed that homogeneous crystallization of CaCO 3 involves an initial formation of thin plate-shaped nuclei which subsequently reassemble to 3-dimensional particles, first of fractal and finally of compact structure. The presence of the egg-white protein ovalbumin leads to a different progression of mineralization through several stages; the first step represents amorphous CaCO 3, whereas the other phases are crystalline. The formation and dissolution of the amorphous phase is accompanied by Ca (2+)-mediated unfolding and cross-linking of about 50 protein monomers showing the characteristic scattering of linear chains with a large statistical segment length. The protein complexes act as nucleation centers for the amorphous phase because of their enrichment by Ca (2+) ions. SANS revealed the sequential formation of CaCO 3 starting from the amorphous phase and the subsequent formation of the crystalline polymorphs vaterite and aragonite. This formation from less dense to more dense polymorphs follows the Ostwald-Volmer rule.},

abstract = {An individual's susceptibility to everyday cognitive failure constitutes a risk factor for physical and mental health. Different factors such as inefficiency of executive functioning and high trait impulsivity have been shown to affect this susceptibility. Furthermore, twin studies indicate a high heritability of failure susceptibility revealing genetic variables as an important biological influence. We tested for a molecular genetic association between variants on the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2), which relate to executive control and impulsivity, and susceptibility to everyday cognitive failure as assessed by the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) in a sample of N=500 (n=140 male, n=360 female, mean age M=24.62, SD=7.98) healthy participants of central European descent. Moreover, we assessed whether trait impulsivity as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) qualifies as a mediator between DRD2 variants and CFQ scores. We found a positive association between DRD2 variants and the CFQ. This effect was in part yet not completely mediated by trait impulsivity. The DRD2C/C variant constitutes a protective factor for the susceptibility to everyday cognitive failure. Results point towards at least two biopsychological pathways that may explain the observed effect.},

abstract = {The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) continues to view with concern the lean pipeline for novel therapeutics to treat drug-resistant infections, especially those caused by gram-negative pathogens. Infections now occur that are resistant to all current antibacterial options. Although the IDSA is encouraged by the prospect of success for some agents currently in preclinical development, there is an urgent, immediate need for new agents with activity against these panresistant organisms. There is no evidence that this need will be met in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we remain concerned that the infrastructure for discovering and developing new antibacterials continues to stagnate, thereby risking the future pipeline of antibacterial drugs. The IDSA proposed solutions in its 2004 policy report, "Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic R{\&}D Stagnates, a Public Health Crisis Brews," and recently issued a "Call to Action" to provide an update on the scope of the problem and the proposed solutions. A primary objective of these periodic reports is to encourage a community and legislative response to establish greater financial parity between the antimicrobial development and the development of other drugs. Although recent actions of the Food and Drug Administration and the 110th US Congress present a glimmer of hope, significant uncertainly remains. Now, more than ever, it is essential to create a robust and sustainable antibacterial research and development infrastructure--one that can respond to current antibacterial resistance now and anticipate evolving resistance. This challenge requires that industry, academia, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Department of Defense, and the new Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services work productively together. This report provides an update on potentially effective antibacterial drugs in the late-stage development pipeline, in the hope of encouraging such collaborative action.},

abstract = {Ensemble musicians play in synchrony despite expressively motivated irregularities in timing. We hypothesized that synchrony is achieved by each performer internally simulating the concurrent actions of other ensemble members, relying initially on how they would perform in their stead. Hence, musicians should be better at synchronizing with recordings of their own earlier performances than with others' recordings. We required pianists to record one part from each of several piano duets, and later to play the complementary part in synchrony with their own or others' recordings. The pianists were also asked to identify their own recordings. The pianists were better at synchronizing with their own than with others' performances, and they were able to recognize their own recordings. Furthermore, synchronization accuracy and recognition were correlated: Pianists who were relatively accurate at synchronizing with their own performances were also good at recognizing them. Thus, action simulation may underlie both synchronization and self-recognition.},

The results of an act-nomination and frequency study of college students provided an initial definition and exploration of this type of relationship. Booty calls tend to utilize various communication mediums to facilitate sexual contact among friends who, for men, may represent low-investment, attractive sexual partners and, for women, may represent attractive test-mates. The relationship is discussed as a compromise between men's and women's ideal mating strategies that allows men greater sexual access and women an ongoing opportunity to evaluate potential long-term mates.},

Both prenatal testosterone and the AR play a central role in penile growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between digit ratio and penile length. Korean men who were hospitalized for urological surgery at a single tertiary academic centre were examined in this study, and 144 men aged 20 years or older who gave informed consent were prospectively enrolled. Right-hand second- and fourth-digit lengths were measured by a single investigator prior to measurement of penile length. Under anaesthesia, flaccid and stretched penile lengths were measured by another investigator who did not measure nor have any the information regarding the digit lengths. Univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models showed that only height was a significant predictive factor for flaccid penile length (univariate analysis: r=0.185, P=0.026; multivariate analysis: r=0.172, P=0.038) and that only digit ratio was a significant predictive factor for stretched penile length (univariate analysis:r=-0.216, P=0.009; multivariate analysis: r=-0.201, P=0.024; stretched penile length=-9.201×digit ratio + 20.577). Based on this evidence, we suggest that the digit ratio can predict adult penile size and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the differences in adult penile length.Asian Journal of Andrology advance online publication, 4 July 2011; doi:10.1038/aja.2011.75.},

abstract = {We report successful levitation of large water droplets and mice using a newly built variable gravity simulator. The simulator consists mainly of a superconducting magnet with a room temperature accessible experimental levitating space. The superconducting magnet generates a field and field gradient product that is large enough to levitate water and many other common liquids. The warm bore of the magnet has a diameter of 66mm, large enough to levitate small mammals. We demonstrate that water drops up to 50mm in diameter and young mice can be levitated in the system. The capability of levitating large water drops and biological systems offers new opportunities for conducting detailed and in-depth study of properties of fluids and biological systems in reduced gravity environments.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\$}\backslashsim N{\^{}}2{\$} for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Repeated measures design. OBJECTIVE: To describe male spine movement and posture characteristics during coitus and compare these characteristics across 5 common coital positions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Exacerbation of pain during coitus due to coital movements and positions is a prevalent issue reported by low back pain patients. A biomechanical analysis of spine movements and postures during coitus has never been conducted. METHODS: Ten healthy males and females engaged in coitus in the following preselected positions and variations: QUADRUPED, MISSIONARY, and SIDELYING. An optoelectronic motion capture system was used to measure 3-dimensional lumbar spine angles that were normalized to upright standing. To determine whether each coital position had distinct spine kinematic profiles, separate univariate general linear models, followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc analysis were used. The presentation of coital positions was randomized. RESULTS: Both variations of QUADRUPED, mQUAD1 and mQUAD2, were found to have a significantly higher cycle speed than mSIDE (P = 0.043 and P = 0.034, respectively), mMISS1 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively), and mMISS2 (P = 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Male lumbar spine movement varied depending on the coital position; however, across all positions, the majority of the range of motion used was in flexion. Based on range of motion, the least-to-most recommended positions for a male flexion-intolerant patient are mSIDE, mMISS2, mQUAD2, mMISS1, and mQUAD1. CONCLUSION: Initial recommendations-which include specific coital positions to avoid, movement strategies, and role of the partner-were developed for male patients whose low back pain is exacerbated by specific motions and postures.

Because the fellatrix or fellator may be unaware of the etiology of the lesions or may be reluctant to provide these details of the sexual history, the clinician needs to have a high index of suspicion based on the patient's clinical presentation and collaborating history of preceding fellatio.},

Standardly, the goal of fixing meanings is seen as being realized through the alignment of terms on what are called ‘concepts.' Part I addresses three versions of the concept-based approach—by Cimino, by W{\"{u}}ster, and by Campbell and associates—and surveys some of the problems to which they give rise, all of which have to do with a failure to anchor the terms in terminologies to corresponding referents in reality. Part II outlines a new, realist solution to this anchorage problem, which sees terminology construction as being motivated by the goal of alignment not on concepts but on the universals (kinds, types) in reality and thereby also on the corresponding instances (individuals, tokens). We outline the realist approach and show how on its basis we can provide a benchmark of correctness for terminologies which will at the same time allow a new type of integration of terminologies and electronic health records. We conclude by outlining ways in which the framework thus defined might be exploited for purposes of diagnostic decision-support.},

abstract = {The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been devastating amphibians globally. Two general scenarios have been proposed for the nature and spread of this pathogen: Bd is an epidemic, spreading as a wave and wiping out individuals, populations, and species in its path; and Bd is endemic, widespread throughout many geographic regions on every continent except Antarctica. To explore these hypotheses, we conducted a transcontinental transect of United States Department of Defense (DoD) installations along U.S. Highway 66 from California to central Illinois, and continuing eastward to the Atlantic Seaboard along U.S. Interstate 64 (in sum from Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia). We addressed the following questions: 1) Does Bd occur in amphibian populations on protected DoD environments? 2) Is there a temporal pattern to the presence of Bd? 3) Is there a spatial pattern to the presence of Bd? and 4) In these limited human-traffic areas, is Bd acting as an epidemic (i.e., with evidence of recent introduction and/or die-offs due to chytridiomycosis), or as an endemic (present without clinical signs of disease)? Bd was detected on 13 of the 15 bases sampled. Samples from 30 amphibian species were collected (10{\%} of known United States' species); half (15) tested Bd positive. There was a strong temporal (seasonal) component; in total, 78.5{\%} of all positive samples came in the first (spring/early-summer) sampling period. There was also a strong spatial component—the eleven temperate DoD installations had higher prevalences of Bd infection (20.8{\%}) than the four arid ({\textless}60 mm annual precipitation) bases (8.5{\%}). These data support the conclusion that Bd is now widespread, and promote the idea that Bd can today be considered endemic across much of North America, extending from coast-to-coast, with the exception of remote pockets of na{\"{i}}ve populations.},

abstract = {We demonstrate by means of simple, noninvasive methods (analysis of satellite images, field observations, and measuring "deer beds" in snow) that domestic cattle (n = 8,510 in 308 pastures) across the globe, and grazing and resting red and roe deer (n = 2,974 at 241 localities), align their body axes in roughly a north-south direction. Direct observations of roe deer revealed that animals orient their heads northward when grazing or resting. Amazingly, this ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to have been noticed by herdsmen, ranchers, or hunters. Because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation, magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation. To test the hypothesis that cattle orient their body axes along the field lines of the Earth's magnetic field, we analyzed the body orientation of cattle from localities with high magnetic declination. Here, magnetic north was a better predictor than geographic north. This study reveals the magnetic alignment in large mammals based on statistically sufficient sample sizes. Our findings open horizons for the study of magnetoreception in general and are of potential significance for applied ethology (husbandry, animal welfare). They challenge neuroscientists and biophysics to explain the proximate mechanisms.},

abstract = {Hard facts on a soft matter! In their popular scientific book (Leyner M, Goldberg B. Why do men have nipples - hundreds of questions you'd only ask a doctor after your third martini. New York: Three Rivers Press; 2005), Leyner and Goldberg raised the question why "some belly buttons collect so much lint". They were, however, not able to come up with a satisfactory answer. The hypothesis presented herein says that abdominal hair is mainly responsible for the accumulation of navel lint, which, therefore, this is a typically male phenomenon. The abdominal hair collects fibers from cotton shirts and directs them into the navel where they are compacted to a felt-like matter. The most abundant individual mass of a piece of lint was found to be between 1.20 and 1.29 mg (n=503). However, due to several much larger pieces, the average mass was 1.82 mg in this three year study. When the abdominal hair is shaved, no more lint is collected. Old T-shirts or dress shirts produce less navel fuzz than brand new T-shirts. Using elemental analysis, it could be shown that cotton lint contains a certain amount of foreign material, supposedly cutaneous scales, fat or proteins. Incidentally, lint might thus fulfill a cleaning function for the navel.},

abstract = {We present two studies of online ephemerality and anonymity based on the popular discussion board /b/ at 4chan.org: a website with over 7 million users that plays an influential role in Internet culture. Although researchers and practitioners often assume that user identity and data permanence are central tools in the design of online communities, we explore how /b/ succeeds despite being almost entirely anonymous and extremely ephemeral. We begin by describing /b/ and performing a content analysis that suggests the community is dominated by playful exchanges of images and links. Our first study uses a large dataset of more than five million posts to quantify ephemerality in /b/. We find that most threads spend just five seconds on the first page and less than five minutes on the site before expiring. Our second study is an analysis of identity signals on 4chan, finding that over 90{\%} of posts are made by fully anonymous users, with other identity signals adopted and discarded at will. We describe alternative mechanisms that /b/ participants use to establish status and frame their interactions.},

abstract = {The average potency of illicit marijuana in the USA has increased substantially over the past four decades, and observers have suggested a number of likely reasons for this. One set of hypotheses points to a market that has evolved from foreign to domestic sources of supply, and to continuing advances in sophisticated cultivation techniques. Another set of hypotheses points to testing artifacts related to changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana. The current study uses data from the federally sponsored Potency Monitoring Program, which performs ongoing forensic analysis of seized marijuana samples, to assess the extent to which the observed increase in cannabis potency in the USA between 1970 and 2010 is a function of genuine shifts in illicit marijuana markets or testing artifacts related to changes in the quality of seized marijuana. The study finds, after adjusting for marijuana quality, that the apparent 10.5 factor increase in mean reported THC{\%} between the 1970s and the 2000s is instead on the order of a six- to seven-fold increase. By this accounting, then, the reported long-term rise in potency is roughly 57-67{\%} as great when the quality of the tested marijuana is taken into account. This study's findings, therefore, caution against the uncritical use of potency monitoring data and highlight the importance of assessing potency measurement reliability and addressing data quality issues in future policy analytic research.

Undergraduate students (61 men and 114 women) indicated the level of perceived sexism present in their most frequently played video games. Students also completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Glick {\&} Fiske, 1996), which measures both hostile and benevolent sexism. As predicted, men who played video games perceived to be high in sexism showed higher levels of benevolent sexism, compared with men who did not play such games. This relationship was not evident for women. Importantly, our study provides the first known evidence of a link between long-term exposure to sexist video games and sexist attitudes. Although correlational, these data are consistent with the notion that sexist video games encourage and reinforce sexist attitudes.

abstract = {Humans have the unique ability to create art, but non-human animals may be able to discriminate "good" art from "bad" art. In this study, I investigated whether pigeons could be trained to discriminate between paintings that had been judged by humans as either "bad" or "good". To do this, adult human observers first classified several children's paintings as either "good" (beautiful) or "bad" (ugly). Using operant conditioning procedures, pigeons were then reinforced for pecking at "good" paintings. After the pigeons learned the discrimination task, they were presented with novel pictures of both "good" and "bad" children's paintings to test whether they had successfully learned to discriminate between these two stimulus categories. The results showed that pigeons could discriminate novel "good" and "bad" paintings. Then, to determine which cues the subjects used for the discrimination, I conducted tests of the stimuli when the paintings were of reduced size or grayscale. In addition, I tested their ability to discriminate when the painting stimuli were mosaic and partial occluded. The pigeons maintained discrimination performance when the paintings were reduced in size. However, discrimination performance decreased when stimuli were presented as grayscale images or when a mosaic effect was applied to the original stimuli in order to disrupt spatial frequency. Thus, the pigeons used both color and pattern cues for their discrimination. The partial occlusion did not disrupt the discriminative behavior suggesting that the pigeons did not attend to particular parts, namely upper, lower, left or right half, of the paintings. These results suggest that the pigeons are capable of learning the concept of a stimulus class that humans name "good" pictures. The second experiment showed that pigeons learned to discriminate watercolor paintings from pastel paintings. The subjects showed generalization to novel paintings. Then, as the first experiment, size reduction test, grayscale test, mosaic processing test and partial occlusion test were carried out. The results suggest that the pigeons used both color and pattern cues for the discrimination and show that non-human animals, such as pigeons, can be trained to discriminate abstract visual stimuli, such as pictures and may also have the ability to learn the concept of "beauty" as defined by humans.},

abstract = {Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), also known as histidine-proline-rich glyco-protein, is an abundant and well-characterized protein of vertebrate plasma. HRG has a multidomain structure that allows the molecule to interact with many ligands, including heparin, phospholipids, plasminogen, fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G, C1q, heme, and Zn²(+). The ability of HRG to interact with various ligands simultaneously has suggested that HRG can function as an adaptor molecule and regulate numerous important biologic processes, such as immune complex/necrotic cell/pathogen clearance, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. The present review covers the proposed multifunctional roles of HRG with a focus on recent findings that have led to its emergence as a key regulator of immunity and vascular biology. Also included is a discussion of the striking functional similarities between HRG and other important multifunctional proteins found in plasma, such as C-reactive protein, C1q, $\beta$₂ glycoprotein I, and thrombospondin-1.},

abstract = {Face pareidolia is the illusory perception of non-existent faces. The present study, for the first time, contrasted behavioral and neural responses of face pareidolia with those of letter pareidolia to explore face-specific behavioral and neural responses during illusory face processing. Participants were shown pure-noise images but were led to believe that 50{\%} of them contained either faces or letters; they reported seeing faces or letters illusorily 34{\%} and 38{\%} of the time, respectively. The right fusiform face area (rFFA) showed a specific response when participants "saw" faces as opposed to letters in the pure-noise images. Behavioral responses during face pareidolia produced a classification image (CI) that resembled a face, whereas those during letter pareidolia produced a CI that was letter-like. Further, the extent to which such behavioral CIs resembled faces was directly related to the level of face-specific activations in the rFFA. This finding suggests that the rFFA plays a specific role not only in processing of real faces but also in illusory face perception, perhaps serving to facilitate the interaction between bottom-up information from the primary visual cortex and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole brain analyses revealed a network specialized in face pareidolia, including both the frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Our findings suggest that human face processing has a strong top-down component whereby sensory input with even the slightest suggestion of a face can result in the interpretation of a face.},

abstract = {When the moon is absent from the night sky, stars remain as celestial visual cues. Nonetheless, only birds, seals, and humans are known to use stars for orientation. African ball-rolling dung beetles exploit the sun, the moon, and the celestial polarization pattern to move along straight paths, away from the intense competition at the dung pile. Even on clear moonless nights, many beetles still manage to orientate along straight paths. This led us to hypothesize that dung beetles exploit the starry sky for orientation, a feat that has, to our knowledge, never been demonstrated in an insect. Here, we show that dung beetles transport their dung balls along straight paths under a starlit sky but lose this ability under overcast conditions. In a planetarium, the beetles orientate equally well when rolling under a full starlit sky as when only the Milky Way is present. The use of this bidirectional celestial cue for orientation has been proposed for vertebrates, spiders, and insects, but never proven. This finding represents the first convincing demonstration for the use of the starry sky for orientation in insects and provides the first documented use of the Milky Way for orientation in the animal kingdom.},

abstract = {We observed a total of 57 incidences of copulation in a colony of the Indian flying fox, Pteropus giganteus, over 13 months under natural conditions. The colony consisted of about 420 individuals, roosting in a Ficus religiosa tree. Copulations occurred between 07.00 h and 09.30 h from July to January, with more occurring in October and November. Initially males groomed their penis before approaching a nearby female. Females typically moved away and males followed. When the female stopped moving, the male started licking her vagina (cunnilingus). Typically each bout of cunnilingus lasted for about 50 s. In 57 out of 69 observations, the male mounted the female and copulated. The duration of copulation varied from 10 to 20 sec. After completion of copulation, the male continued cunnilingus for 94 to 188 sec. The duration of pre-copulatory cunnilingus and copulation was positively correlated whereas, the duration of pre- and post-copulatory cunnilingus was negatively correlated. Apart from humans, oral sex as foreplay prior to copulation is uncommon in mammals. Another pteropodid bat, Cynopterus sphinx exhibits fellatio with females licking the penis of males during copulation. It appears that bats, especially pteropodids perform oral sex, either cunnilingus or fellatio, possibly for achieving longer copulation.},

abstract = {Far too often, I have read articles that tout the benefits of humor. The same benefits are mentioned over and over, with only passing acknowledgement of potential harms such as offense, distraction, and eroding the gravitas or authority of its user.  Isn't it time for an article that differentiates between the physical act of laughing and the mental gymnastics of “getting” humor? Can't we go beyond speculating about whether humor or laughter might help, or could help? Even if we could demonstrate that humor did help in a certain situation, would that justify it as the treatment of choice? Wouldn't we have to demonstrate that humor worked better than established methods, whose side effects are well known and can be managed?  Using humor for any reason other than superior effectiveness seems self-indulgent, and we are notoriously immune to counter-evidence when we are indulging ourselves. It is often blithely said that journalist Norman Cousins laughed his way out of a fatal disease. We too easily ignore facts such as Cousins' likely misdiagnosis with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We now know that it is largely genetic, with more than 90{\%} of those affected having the genotype HLA-B27 (Spondylitis Association of America, 2009). It seems unlikely that Cousins suddenly acquired this during a trip to Russia. Even if he had actually had AS, his recovery would have been fortunate, but not miraculous. When his friend, Dr. Hitzig, consulted the experts at Dr. Howard Rusk's clinic, he was told that Cousins had one chance in 500 of a full recovery (Cousins, 1979/2005, p. 33).  Because we are enjoying our use of humor, we too easily buy into folk wisdom, such as the notion that laughter generates or increases the flow of endorphins (rarely tested and never found). We believe that adults laugh only 15 times per day, while children laugh more than 400 times (no one has found a legitimate source for this claim). We are quick to judge the client who does not appreciate our humor as depressed or resistant. We are quick to take our friends' laughter as evidence of our effectiveness. I have seen many people using humor that interferes with their productivity and/or relationships, but who are firmly convinced that it makes them better workers.  I want to challenge professional researchers to give this matter more objective and rigorous investigation.},

Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

abstract = {Organisms 'discount the future' when they value imminent goods over future goods. Optimal discounting varies: selection should favour allocations of effort that effectively discount the future relatively steeply in response to cues promising relatively good returns on present efforts. However, research on human discounting has hitherto focused on stable individual differences rather than situational effects. In two experiments, discounting was assessed on the basis of choices between a smaller sum of money tomorrow and a larger sum at a later date, both before and after subjects rated the 'appeal' of 12 photographs. In experiment 1, men and women saw either attractive or unattractive opposite-sex faces; in experiment 2, participants saw more or less appealing cars. As predicted, discounting increased significantly in men who viewed attractive women, but not in men who viewed unattractive women or women who viewed men; viewing cars produced a different pattern of results.},

Hollow microspheres were surface modified by coating with a silica nanolayer. Pristine and modified hollow microparticles were characterized by field-emission electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, and VSM magnetometry. The potential application of the modified hollow magnetite microspheres as a drug carrier was evaluated by using Rhodamine B and methotrexate as model drugs. The loading and release kinetics of both molecules showed a clear pH and temperature dependent profile. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: Hollow magnetite microspheres have been synthesized. Load-release experiments with Rhodamine-B as a model drug and with Methotrexate (chemotherapy drug used in treating certain types of cancer) demonstrated the potential applications of these nanostructures in biomedical applications.},

abstract = {A novel double-layer nanostructure of silicon carbide and tungsten oxide is synthesized by a two-step thermal evaporation process using NiO as the catalyst. First, SiC nanowires are grown on Si substrate and then high density W(18)O(49) nanorods are grown on these SiC nanowires to form a double-layer nanostructure. XRD and TEM analysis revealed that the synthesized nanostructures are well crystalline. The growth of W(18)O(49) nanorods on SiC nanowires is explained on the basis of vapor-solid (VS) mechanism. The reasonably better turn-on field (5.4 V/mum) measured from the field emission measurements suggest that the synthesized nanostructures could be used as potential field emitters.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT)-organic polymer hybrids have important potential applications in the immobilization of therapeutic biomolecules. Recently developed CNT-organic polymer composites require the use of organic solvents for their preparation and have limited polymer functionalization. To address these limitations, multi-walled CNT (MWCNT)-chitosan nanoparticle (CS NP) hybrids have been synthesized in situ by an ionotropic gelation process, which is extremely mild and involves the mixture of two aqueous solutions at room temperature. The MWCNT-CS NP hybrids were characterized by atomic force microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Under optimal conditions the CS NP can be tethered to the MWCNT surface in high density and with relatively uniform coverage. The MWCNT-CS NP hybrids show good dispersibility and stability in aqueous solutions. In order to evaluate the potential utilization of the hybrids as protein carries the cytotoxicity to HeLa cells and protein immobilization (of bovine serum albumin (BSA), used here as a model) capacity of the hybrids were investigated in detail. The results demonstrate that the MWCNT-CS NP hybrids are biocompatible at concentrations up to 100 $\mu$g mL(-1) for 24 h incubation. The MWCNT-CS NP hybrids improve the BSA immobilization efficiency 0.8 times and simultaneously decrease the cellular toxicity by about 50{\%} compared with carboxylated MWCNT.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube-copper (CNT/Cu) composites have been successfully synthesized by means of a novel particles-compositing process followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The thermal conductivity of the composites was measured by a laser flash technique and theoretical analyzed using an effective medium approach. The experimental results showed that the thermal conductivity unusually decreased after the incorporation of CNTs. Theoretical analyses revealed that the interfacial thermal resistance between the CNTs and the Cu matrix plays a crucial role in determining the thermal conductivity of bulk composites, and only small interfacial thermal resistance can induce a significant degradation in thermal conductivity for CNT/Cu composites. The influence of sintering condition on the thermal conductivity depended on the combined effects of multiple factors, i.e. porosity, CNTs distribution and CNT kinks or twists. The composites sintered at 600°C for 5 min under 50 MPa showed the maximum thermal conductivity. CNT/Cu composites are considered to be a promising material for thermal management applications.},

abstract = {Partially aligned polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based nanofibers were electrospun from PAN and PAN/single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in a solution of dimethylformamide (DMF) to make the nanofiber composites. The as-spun nanofibers were then hot-stretched in the oven to enhance its orientation and crystallinity. With the introduction of SWNTs and by the hot-stretched process, the mechanical properties will be enhanced correspondingly. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray scattering (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the tensile test were used to characterize the microstructure and performances of the nanofibers. The orientation and crystallinity of the as-spun and hot-stretched nanofibers confirmed by X-ray have increased. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the glass transition temperature of PAN increased about 3 °C by an addition of 0.75 wt{\%} SWNTs indicating a strong interfacial interaction between PAN and SWNTs. The tensile strength and the modulus of the nanofibers increased revealing significant load transfer across the nanotube-matrix interface. For PAN nanofibers, the improved fiber alignment, orientation and crystallinity resulted in enhanced mechanical properties, such as the tensile strength and modulus of the nanofibers. It was concluded that the hot-stretched nanofiber and the PAN/SWNTs nanofibers can be used as a potential precursor to produce high-performance nanocomposites.},

Even with highly disordered commercial porous anodic aluminum oxide template and conventional potentiostatic electrodeposition, length uniformity over 95{\%} can be achieved when the deposition temperature is lowered down to -2.4°C. Decreased diffusion coefficient and ion concentration gradient due to the lowered deposition temperature effectively reduces ion diffusion rate, thereby favors uniform nanowire growth. Moreover, by varying the deposition temperature, we show that also the pore nucleation and the crystallinity can be controlled.},

Preformed CdS nanowires with a diameter of ca. 45 nm and a length up to several tens of micrometers were coated with a layer of ZnS shell by the reaction of zinc acetate and thiourea at 180 °C for 10 h. It was found that uniform ZnS shell was composed of ZnS nanoparticles with a diameter of ca. 4 nm, which anchored on the nanowires without any surface pretreatment. The 1D CdS@ZnS core-shell nanocomposites were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, ED, and EDS techniques. The optical properties and photocatalytic activities of the 1D CdS@ZnS core-shell nanocomposites towards methylene blue (MB) and 4-chlorophenol (4CP) under visible light ($\lambda$ {\textgreater} 420 nm) were separately investigated. The results show that the ZnS shell can effectively passivate the surface electronic states of the CdS cores, which accounts for the enhanced photocatalytic activities of the 1D CdS@ZnS core-shell nanocomposites compared to that of the uncoated CdS nanowires.},

The F-MWNTs were functionalized by Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduced aromatic amine (COC(6)H(4)-NH(2)) groups onto the side wall. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images obtained from the fractured surfaces of the nanocomposites showed that the F-MWNTs in the nylon-6 matrix were well dispersed as compared to those of the P-MWNTs. Both nanocomposites could be electrospun into nanofibers in which the MWNTs were embedded and oriented along the nanofiber axis, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The specific strength and modulus of the MWNTs-reinforced nanofibers increased as compared to those of the neat nylon-6 nanofibers. The crystal structure of the nylon-6 in the MWNT/nylon-6 nanofibers was mostly gamma-phase, although that of the MWNT/nylon-6 films, which were prepared by hot-pressing the pellets between two aluminum plates and then quenching them in icy water, was mostly alpha-phase, indicating that the shear force during electrospinning might favor the gamma-phase, similarly to the conventional fiber spinning.},

The electronic structure of CdS in the nanocomposite is similar to that of bulk, but showing the expected features of two-dimensional confinement of the semiconductor. The nanocomposite band gap is found to depend in a non-linear manner on both the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant and the concentration of the sulphide in the inorganic sheet. The products show photocatalytic activity at least similar and usually better than that of "bulk" CdS in a factor of two.},

@article{Lin2010a,
abstract = {Recent studies on the intercalation and exfoliation of layered clays with polymeric intercalating agents involving poly(oxypropylene)-amines and the particular uses for epoxy nanocomposites are reviewed. For intercalation, counter-ionic exchange reactions of clays including cationic layered silicates and anionic Al-Mg layered double hydroxide (LDH) with polymeric organic ions afforded organoclays led to spatial interlayer expansion from 12 to 92 {\AA} (X-ray diffraction) as well as hydrophobic property. The inorganic clays of layered structure could be modified by the poly(oxypropylene)amine-salts as the intercalating agents with molecular weights ranging from 230 to 5,000 g/mol. Furthermore, natural montmorillonite (MMT) clay could be exfoliated into thin layer silicate platelets (ca. 1 nm thickness) in one step by using polymeric types of exfoliating agents. Different lateral dimensions of MMT, synthetic fluorinated Mica and LDH clays had been cured into epoxy nanocomposites. The hydrophobic amine-salt modification resulting in high spacing of layered or exfoliation of individual clay platelets is the most important factor for gaining significant improvements of properties. In particular, these modified clays were reported to gain significant improvements such as reduced coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), enhanced thermal stability, and hardness. The utilization of these layered clays for initiating the epoxy self-polymerization was also reported to have a unique compatibility between clay and organic resin matrix. However, the matrix domain lacks of covalently bonded crosslink and leads to the isolation of powder material. It is generally concluded that the hydrophobic expansion of the clay inter-gallery spacing is the crucial step for enhancing the compatibility and the ultimate preparation of the advanced epoxy materials.},

abstract = {The ideal wound-healing scaffold should provide the appropriate physical and mechanical properties to prevent secondary infection, as well as an excellent physiological environment to facilitate cell adhesion, proliferation and/or differentiation. Therefore, we developed a synthetic cell-adhesive polypeptide hydrogel with inherent antibacterial activity. A series of polypeptides, poly(Lys)(x)(Ala)(y) (x+y=100), with varied hydrophobicity via metal-free ring-opening polymerization of NCA-Lys(Boc) and NCA-Ala monomers (NCA=N-carboxylic anhydride) mediated by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were synthesized. These polypeptides were cross-linked with 6-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG)-amide succinimidyl glutarate (ASG) (M(w)=10K) to form hydrogels with a gelation time of five minutes and a storage modulus (G') of 1400-3000 Pa as characterized by rheometry. The hydrogel formed by cross-linking of poly(Lys)(60)(Ala)(40) (5 wt.{\%}) and 6-arm PEG-ASG (16 wt.{\%}) (Gel-III) exhibited cell adhesion and cell proliferation activities superior to other polypeptide hydrogels. In addition, Gel-III displays significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli JM109 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923. Thus, we have developed a novel, cell-adhesive hydrogel with inherent antibacterial activity as a potential scaffold for cutaneous wound healing.},

As the 21st century unfolds, it is becoming more apparent that the next technological frontiers will be opened not through a better understanding and application of a particular material, but rather by understanding and optimizing material combinations and their synergistic function, hence blurring the distinction between a material and a functional device comprised of distinct materials},

abstract = {Polymer/organically modified layered silicate (PLS) nanocomposites are a new class of filled polymers with ultrafine phase dimensions. They offer an outstanding combination of stiffness, strength and weight that is difficult to attain separately from the individual components. Additionally, the nanoscopic phase distribution as well as synergism between polymer and the layered silicate result in additional properties, such as flame retardency, enhanced barrier properties and ablation resistance, which are not observed in either component. These nanocomposites are synthesized by blending the organically modified layered silicate (OLS) into the polymer melt. Thus, understanding the relationship between the molecular structure and the thermal stability (decomposition temperature, rate, and the degradation products) of the organic modification of the layered silicate is critical. During this study, modern thermal analysis techniques combined with infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (TGA–FTIR–MS) were used to obtain information on the thermal stability and degradation products. The effect of chemical variation (alkyl chain length, number of alkyls, and unsaturation) of organic modifiers on the thermal stability of the organically exchanged montmorillonite are discussed. A range of interesting results is observed, however, not all are currently understandable.},

In order to implement the practical application, the particles must have combined properties of high magnetic saturation, stability, biocompatibility, and interactive functions at the surface. Moreover, the surface of iron oxide NPs could be modified by organic materials or inorganic materials, such as polymers, biomolecules, silica, metals, etc. The problems and major challenges, along with the directions for the synthesis and surface functionalization of iron oxide NPs, are considered.

@article{Bian2005,
abstract = {This work explores the use of conformal nanoscale plasma coatings on the surface of boron nitride (BN) powders to control the rheological properties of BN/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) composites. BN particles are conformally coated with hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) in a tumbling RF-plasma reactor. Following the HFPO plasma treatment, XPS evidence indicates the presence of thin coating on the surface of the particles having a F:C ratio of 1.77. Filled BN/PDMS composites are investigated using oscillatory shear rheometry in the concentration range of 0.09-0.41 vol{\%} (varphi). The addition of the plasma treated BN particles to the PDMS matrix reduces the complex viscosity by 40-60{\%} when compared with equally loaded control samples across a broad concentration range. The frequency dependence of the maximum packing fraction (varphi(m)=0.38-0.42) is also observed for both treated and untreated particles. The maximum packing fraction does not appear to be significantly affected by the conformal plasma polymer treatment. The investigation has shown that the relative dynamic viscosity of the BN/PDMS can be described by the modified Mooney equation.},

Herein, we demonstrated the systematic fabrication of Ni nanotube and nanowire arrays and proposed an original growth mechanism. With the different deposition time, nanotubes or nanowires can be obtained. Tubular nanostructures can be obtained at short time, while nanowires take longer time to form. This formation mechanism is applicable to design and synthesize other metal nanostructures and even compound nanostuctures via template-based electrodeposition.},

abstract = {This project work considers natural fibre reinforced composites for wind turbine blades and nacelle cover manufacture. The King palm leaves which are readily available, were sourced to extract the staple fibres which were thereafter used as reinforcement for the epoxy and unsaturated polyester matrices. The composite fabrication was done using the hand lay-up method via the use of a silicon mould (for epoxy matrix) and a metallic mould (for UPR matrix). The composite samples obtained were thereafter, tested for the effect of the fibres on the matrices. A mechanical tensile test was precisely carried out on both samples of the epoxy and unsaturated polyester (UPR) composites. The results gotten were analysed to see the effect the King palm staple fibre has on the epoxy and UPR matrix. Also the effects of fibre content on some mechanical properties were also considered. From the result analysis, conclusions were drawn on how suitable natural King palm staple fibres could serve as good reinforcement in polymer composites.},

abstract = {The unique size- and shape-dependent electronic properties of nanocrystals (NCs) make them extremely attractive as novel structural building blocks for constructing a new generation of innovative materials and solid-state devices. Recent advances in material chemistry has allowed the synthesis of colloidal NCs with a wide range of compositions, with a precise control on size, shape and uniformity as well as specific surface chemistry. By incorporating such nanostructures in polymers, mesoscopic materials can be achieved and their properties engineered by choosing NCs differing in size and/or composition, properly tuning the interaction between NCs and surrounding environment. In this contribution, different approaches will be presented as effective opportunities for conveying colloidal NC properties to nanocomposite materials for micro and nanofabrication. Patterning of such nanocomposites either by conventional lithographic techniques and emerging patterning tools, such as ink jet printing and nanoimprint lithography, will be illustrated, pointing out their technological impact on developing new optoelectronic and sensing devices.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The understanding of the rheological and mechanical properties of nanoparticle aggregates is important for the application of nanofillers in nanocompoistes. In this work, we report a rheological study on the rheological and mechanical properties of nano-silica agglomerates in the form of gel network mainly constructed by hydrogen bonds. The elastic model for rubber is modified to analyze the elastic behavior of the agglomerates. By this modified elastic model, the size of the network mesh can be estimated by the elastic modulus of the network which can be easily obtained by rheology. The stress to destroy the aggregates, i.e., the yield stress ($\sigma$y), and the elastic modulus (G') of the network are found to be depended on the concentration of nano-silica (ϕ, wt.{\%}) with the power of 4.02 and 3.83, respectively. Via this concentration dependent behavior, we can extrapolate two important mechanical parameters for the agglomerates in a dense packing state (ϕ = 1): the shear modulus and the yield stress. Under large deformation (continuous shear flow), the network structure of the aggregates will experience destruction and reconstruction, which gives rise to fluctuations in the viscosity and a shear-thinning behavior.},

High resolution TEM showed that particles obtained by the use of pulsed laser were crystalline, while those obtained by the use of CW laser were amorphous.

abstract = {In bone engineering, the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells rely on signaling from chemico-physical structure of the substrate, therefore prompting the design of mimetic "extracellular matrix"-like scaffolds. In this study, three-dimensional porous poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)-based scaffolds have been mixed with different components, including single walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), micro-hydroxyapatite particles (HA), and BMP2, and treated with plasma (PT), to obtain four different nanocomposites: PLLA + CNT, PLLA + CNTHA, PLLA + CNT + HA + BMP2 and PLLA + CNT + HA + PT. Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were derived from the femur of orthopaedic patients, seeded on the scaffolds and cultured under osteogenic induction up to differentiation and mineralization. The release of specific metabolites and temporal gene expression profiles of marrow-derived osteoprogenitors were analyzed at definite time points, relevant to in vitro culture as well as in vivo differentiation. As a result, the role of the different biomimetic components added to the PLLA matrix was deciphered, with BMP2-added scaffolds showing the highest biomimetic activity on cells differentiating to mature osteoblasts. The modification of a polymeric scaffold with reinforcing components which also work as biomimetic cues for cells can effectively direct osteoprogenitor cells differentiation, so as to shorten the time required for mineralization.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Optical integration is essential for practical application, but it remains unexplored for nanoscale devices. A newly designed nanocomposite based on ZnO semiconductor nanowires and Tb(OH)3/SiO2 core/shell nanospheres has been synthesized and studied. The unique sea urchin-type morphology, bright and sharply visible emission bands of lanthanide, and large aspect ratio of ZnO crystalline nanotips make this novel composite an excellent signal receiver, waveguide, and emitter. The multifunctional composite of ZnO nanotips and Tb(OH)3/SiO2 nanoparticles therefore can serve as an integrated nanophotonics hub. Moreover, the composite of ZnO nanotips deposited on a Tb(OH)3/SiO2 photonic crystal can act as a directional light fountain, in which the confined radiation from Tb ions inside the photonic crystal can be well guided and escape through the ZnO nanotips. Therefore, the output emission arising from Tb ions is truly directional, and its intensity can be greatly enhanced. With highly enhanced lasing emissions in ZnO-Tb(OH)3/SiO2 as well as SnO2-Tb(OH)3/SiO2 nanocomposites, we demonstrate that our approach is extremely beneficial for the creation of low threshold and high-power nanolaser.},

abstract = {The functional silica/polyamide-imide composite films were prepared via simple ultrasonic blending, after the silica nanoparticles were modified by cationic surfactant-cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The composite films were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA). CTAB-modified silica nanoparticles were well dispersed in the polyamide-imide matrix, and the amount of silica nanoparticles to PAI was investigated to be from 2 to 10 wt{\%}. Especially, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CET) continuously decreased with the amount of silica particles increasing. The high thermal stability and low coefficient of thermal expansion showed that the nanocomposite films can be widely used in the enamel wire industry.},

abstract = {Preparation of a novel organically modified clay from spent oil base drilling mud (SOBM) that could serve as core-shell clay filler for polymers is herein reported. Due to the hydrophilic nature of clay, its compatibility with polymer matrix was made possible through modification of the surface of the core clay sample with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APTES) compound prior to its use. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to characterize clay surface modification. Electron dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to expose filler chemical composition and morphology, while electrophoresis measurement was used to examine level of filler dispersion. Results show an agglomerated core clay powder after high temperature treatment, while EDX analysis shows that the organically modified clay is composed of chemical inhomogeneities, wherein elemental compositions in weight percent vary from one point to the other in a probe of two points. Micrographs of the 3-APTES coupled SOBM core-shell clay filler clearly show cloudy appearance, while FT-IR indicates 25{\%} and 5{\%} increases in fundamental vibrations band at 1014 cm−1 and 1435 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, 3-APTES coupled core-shell clay was used to prepare epoxy composites and tested for mechanical properties.},

abstract = {Here we describe a lithography scheme based on the local anodic oxidation of germanium film by a scanning atomic force microscope in a humidity-controlled atmosphere. The oxidation kinetics of the Ge film were investigated by a tapping mode, in which a pulsed bias voltage was synchronized and applied with the resonance frequency of the cantilever, and by a contact mode, in which a continuous voltage was applied. In the tapping mode we clearly identified two regimes of oxidation as a function of the applied voltage: the trench width increased linearly during the vertical growth and increased exponentially during the lateral growth. Both regimes of growth were interpreted taking into consideration the Cabrera-Mott mechanism of oxidation applied to the oxide/Ge interface. We also show the feasibility of the bottom-up fabrication process presented in this work by showing a Cu nanowire fabricated on top of a silicon substrate.},

Structural and biochemical characterization have revealed that the curvature of the nanomaterial affect the immobilization yield, the catalytic behavior and the secondary structure of enzymes. Infrared spectroscopy study indicates that the catalytic behavior of the immobilized enzymes is correlated with their $\alpha$-helical content. Hydrolases exhibit higher esterification activity (up to 20-fold) when immobilized on CNTs compared to GO. The covalently immobilized enzymes exhibited comparable or even higher activity compared to the physically adsorbed ones, while they presented higher operational stability. The enhanced catalytic behavior observed for most of the hydrolases covalently immobilized on amine-functionalized CNTs indicate that these functionalized nanomaterials are suitable for the development of efficient nanobiocatalytic systems.},

After uniaxial stretching of the supporting polymer matrix (poly(vinyl alcohol)), the elongated silver nanostructures embedded at low concentration into the polymer matrix ({\textless}1 wt {\%} of Ag) assume the direction of the drawing, yielding materials with a strong dichroic response of the absorption behavior. Accordingly, the film changed its color when observed under linearly polarized light already at moderate drawings. The results obtained suggest that nanocomposite films have potential in applications such as color polarizing filters, radiation responsive polymeric objects and smart flexible films in packaging applications.},

abstract = {The structural and functional design of metal nanoparticles has recently allowed remarkable progress in the development of high-performance catalysts. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are among the most innovative catalysts, despite bulk Au metal being regarded as stable and inactive. The hybridization of metal NPs has attracted major interest in the field of advanced nanocatalysts, due to electro-mediated ligand effects. In practical terms, metal NPs need to be supported on a suitable matrix to avoid any undesirable aggregation; many researchers have reported the potential of polymer-supported AuNPs. However, the use of conventional polymer matrices make it difficult to take full advantage of the inherent properties of the metal NPs, since most of active NPs are imbedded inside the polymer support. This results in poor accessibility for the reactants. Herein, we report the topochemical synthesis of Au and palladium (Pd) bimetallic NPs over the surfaces of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNs), and their exceptional catalytic performance. Highly-dispersed AuPdNPs were successfully synthesized in situ on the crystal surfaces of TOCNs with a very high density of carboxylate groups. The AuPdNPs@TOCN nanocomposites exhibit excellent catalytic efficiencies in the aqueous reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol, depending on the molar ratios of Au and Pd.},

The higher capacity and higher rate capability for hollow nanostructured anode materials than that for the bulk counterparts can be attributed to their higher surface area, shorter path length for Li(+) transport, and more freedom for volume change, which can reduce the overpotential and allow better reaction kinetics at the electrode surface. In this article, we review recent research activities on hollow nanostructured anode materials for Li-ion batteries, including carbon materials, metals, metal oxides, and their hybrid materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight some recent progresses in using these hollow nanomaterials as anode materials to develop Li-ion batteries with high capacity, high rate capability, and excellent cycling stability.},

abstract = {Microfibrous palygorskite clay mineral and nanocrystalline TiO(2) are incorporating in the preparation of nanocomposite films on glass substrates via sol-gel route at 500°C. The synthesis involves a simple chemical method employing nonionic surfactant molecule as pore directing agent along with the acetic acid-based sol-gel route without direct addition of water molecules. Drying and thermal treatment of composite films lead to the elimination of organic material while ensure the formation of TiO(2) nanoparticles homogeneously distributed on the surface of the palygorskite microfibers. TiO(2) nanocomposite films without cracks consisted of small crystallites in size (12-16 nm) and anatase crystal phase was found to cover palygorskite microfibers. The composite films were characterized by microscopy techniques, UV-vis, IR spectroscopy, and porosimetry methods in order to examine their structural properties. Palygorskite/TiO(2) composite films with variable quantities of palygorskite (0-2 w/w ratio) were tested as new photocatalysts in the photo-discoloration of Basic Blue 41 azo-dye in water. These nanocomposite films proved to be very promising photocatalysts and highly effective to dye's discoloration in spite of the small amount of immobilized palygorskite/TiO(2) catalyst onto glass substrates. 3:2 palygorskite/TiO(2) weight ratio was finally the most efficient photocatalyst while reproducible discoloration results of the dye were obtained after three cycles with same catalyst. It was also found that palygorskite showed a positive synergistic effect to the TiO(2) photocatalysis.},

In recent studies we designed novel biomimetic glues which mimic the adhesion mechanism of algae, renowned for their remarkable adherence to wet surfaces. Here we extend our previous studies and propose biomimetic formulations, composed of alginate gel and native phloroglucinol, that do not induce cell cytotoxicity. Characterization of the adherence to tissues showed that adhesion was directly related to the mechanical strength of the cross-linked alginate. Therefore the adhesion strength can be altered by changing the source of the calcium cross-linker, the alginate G-content or the molecular weight of the alginate. The adhesion strength was comparable to that of Tisseel, a commercial tissue adhesive.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In this article, we investigate the storage of lithium ions between two parallel graphene sheets using the continuous approximation and the 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential. The continuous approximation assumes that the carbon atoms can be replaced by a uniform distribution across the surface of the graphene sheets so that the total interaction potential can be approximated by performing surface integrations. The number of ion layers determines the major storage characteristics of the battery, and our results show three distinct ionic configurations, namely single, double, and triple ion forming layers between graphenes. The number densities of lithium ions between the two graphenes are estimated from existing semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations, and the graphene sheets giving rise to the triple ion layers admit the largest storage capacity at all temperatures, followed by a marginal decrease of storage capacity for the case of double ion layers. These two configurations exceed the maximum theoretical storage capacity of graphite. Further, on taking into account the charge-discharge property, the double ion layers are the most preferable choice for enhanced lithium storage. Although the single ion layer provides the least charge storage, it turns out to be the most stable configuration at all temperatures. One application of the present study is for the design of future high energy density alkali batteries using graphene sheets as anodes for which an analytical formulation might greatly facilitate rapid computational results.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Stable magnetic nanofluids containing Fe3O4@Polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by using a facile and novel method, in which one-pot route was used. FeCl3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O was applied as the iron source, and the oxidizing agent to produce PPy. Trisodium citrate (Na3cit) was used as the reducing reagent to form Fe3O4 NPs. The as-prepared nanofluid can keep long-term stability. The Fe3O4@PPy NPs can still keep dispersing well after the nanofluid has been standing for 1 month and no sedimentation is found. The polymerization reaction of the pyrrole monomers took place with Fe3+ ions as the initiator, in which these Fe3+ ions remained in the solution adsorbed on the surface of the Fe3O4 NPs. Thus, the core-shell NPs of Fe3O4@PPy were obtained. The particle size of the as-prepared Fe3O4@PPy can be easily controlled from 7 to 30 nm by the polymerization reaction of the pyrrole monomers. The steric stabilization and weight of the NPs affect the stability of the nanofluids. The as-prepared Fe3O4@PPy NPs exhibit superparamagnetic behavior.},

abstract = {As part of a project to utilize the regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) membranes as a supporting matrix for the attachment and growth of corneal stem/progenitor cells in the development of tissue engineered constructs for the surgical restoration of the ocular surface, the behavior of the aged RSF solutions has been investigated. The solutions were produced from domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) cocoons according to a protocol involving successive dissolution steps, filtration and dialysis. The solutions were kept at 4 degrees C in a refrigerator for a certain period of time until near the gelation time. The changes in molecular conformation were studied by solution-state (1)H NMR, while the flow of the solutions was characterized by rheological method. Upon ageing turbidity developed in solutions and the viscosity continuously decreased prior to a drastic increased near the gelation time. The (1)H resonances of aged solutions showed a consistent downfield shift as compared to the (1)H resonances of the fresh solution. Shear thinning with anomalous short recovery within a certain range of low shear rates occurred in both fresh and aged solutions. While the solutions behave as pseudo-plastic materials, the chain conformation in aged solutions adopted all secondary configurations with beta-strand being predominant.},

The biocidal nature, protein fouling resistance, and fouling release properties of CNT-NCs render them the perfect material for biofouling prevention. At the same time, the cytotoxicity of CNT-NCs can be reduced before applying them as substrates to promote biofilm formation in environmental biotechnology applications. This paper reviews the potential prospects of CNT-NCs to accomplish two widely varying objectives in environmental engineering applications: (i) preventing biofouling, and (ii) promoting the formation of desirable biofilms on materials surface. This paper addresses practical issues such as costs, risks to human health, and ecological impacts that are associated with the application, development and commercialization of CNT-NC technology.},

abstract = {Enzymatic degradation is a major feature of polyester implants in vivo. An in vitro experimental protocol that can simulate and predict the in vivo enzymatic degradation kinetics of implants is of importance not only to our understanding of the scientific issue, but also to the well-being of animals. In this study, we explored the enzymatic degradation of PGS-based materials in vitro, in tissue culture medium or a buffer solution at the pH optima and under static or cyclic mechanical-loading conditions, in the presence of defined concentrations of an esterase. Surprisingly, it was found that the in vitro enzymatic degradation rates of the PGS-based materials were higher in the tissue culture medium than in the buffered solution at the optimum pH 8. The in vitro enzymatic degradation rate of PGS-based biomaterials crosslinked at 125°C for 2 days was approximately 0.6-0.9 mm/month in tissue culture medium, which falls within the range of in vivo degradation rates (0.2-1.5mm/month) of PGS crosslinked at similar conditions. Enzymatic degradation was also further enhanced in relation to mechanical deformation. Hence, in vitro enzymatic degradation of PGS materials conducted in tissue culture medium under appropriate enzymatic conditions can quantitatively capture the features of in vivo degradation of PGS-based materials and can be used to indicate effective strategies for tuning the degradation rates of this material system prior to animal model testing.},

abstract = {The review is devoted to the historical and modern understanding of rheological properties of emulsions in a broad range of concentration. In the limiting case of dilute emulsions, the discussion is based on the analogy and differences in properties of suspensions and emulsions. For concentrated emulsions, the main peculiarities of their rheological behaviour are considered. Different approaches to understand the concentration dependencies of viscosity are presented and compared. The effects of non-Newtonian flow curves and the apparent transition to yielding with increasing concentration of the dispersed phase are discussed. The problem of droplet deformation in shear fields is touched. The highly concentrated emulsions (beyond the limit of closest packing of spherical particles) are treated as visco-plastic media, and the principle features of their rheology (elasticity, yielding, concentration and droplet size dependencies) are considered. A special attention is paid to the problem of shear stability of drops of an internal phase starting from the theory of the single drop behaviour, including approaches for the estimation of drops' stability in concentrated emulsions. Polymer blends are also treated as emulsions, though taking into account their peculiarities due to the coexistence of two interpenetrated phases. Different theoretical models of deformation of polymer drops were discussed bearing in mind the central goal of predictions of the visco-elastic properties of emulsions as functions of the properties of individual components and the interfacial layer. The role of surfactants is discussed from the point of view of stability of emulsions in time and their special influence on the rheology of emulsions.},

This paper presents a simple vapor-phase approach to directly coat solid-state surfaces with biocompatible films without any harsh chemical or plasma treatment. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers were used for reaction and deposition of nanolayer films. The monomers were characterized and showed a very consistent coating of 3D micropore structures.},

The feeding rate and the cooling flow rate were the critical experimental parameters for defining the morphology of the final products. The detailed structures of synthesized ZnS nanostructures were studied through transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscope. A collision-controlled growth mechanism was proposed to explain the growth process that occurred exclusively in the gas current by a flowing way, and the whole process was completed in several seconds. In conclusion, the present synthetic route provides a facile way to synthesize ZnS and other hexagonal-structured 1D nanostructures in a rapid and scalable way.},

abstract = {We have developed an improved three-dimensional (3D) percolation model to investigate the effect of the alignment of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the electrical conductivity of nanocomposites. In this model, both intrinsic and contact resistances are considered, and a new method of resistor network recognition that employs periodically connective paths is developed. This method leads to a reduction in the size effect of the representative cuboid in our Monte Carlo simulations. With this new technique, we were able to effectively analyze the effects of the CNT alignment upon the electrical conductivity of nanocomposites. Our model predicted that the peak value of the conductivity occurs for partially aligned rather than perfectly aligned CNTs. It has also identified the value of the peak and the corresponding alignment for different volume fractions of CNTs. Our model works well for both multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) and single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs), and the numerical results show a quantitative agreement with existing experimental observations.},

abstract = {An efficient electromagnetic shielding composite based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-filled styrene acrylic emulsion-based polymer has been prepared in a water-based system. The MWCNTs were demonstrated to have an effect on the dielectric constants, which effectively enhance electromagnetic shielding efficiency (SE) of the composites. A low conductivity threshold of 0.23 wt{\%} can be obtained. An EMI SE of {\~{}}28 dB was achieved for 20 wt{\%} MWCNTs. The AC conductivity ($\sigma$ac) of the composites, deduced from imaginary permittivity, was used to estimate the SE of the composites in X band (8.2-12.4 GHz), showing a good agreement with the measured results.},

abstract = {The multiple beneficial effects of Al2O3 nanoparticle addition to cast magnesium based systems (followed by extrusion) were investigated, constituting either: (a) enhanced strength; or (b) simultaneously enhanced strength and ductility of the corresponding magnesium alloys. AZ31 and ZK60A nanocomposites containing Al2O3 nanoparticle reinforcement were each fabricated using solidification processing followed by hot extrusion. Compared to monolithic AZ31 (tension levels), the corresponding nanocomposite exhibited higher yield strength (0.2{\%} tensile yield strength (TYS)), ultimate strength (UTS), failure strain and work of fracture (WOF) (+19{\%}, +21{\%}, +113{\%} and +162{\%}, respectively). Compared to monolithic AZ31 (compression levels), the corresponding nanocomposite exhibited higher yield strength (0.2{\%} compressive yield strength (CYS)) and ultimate strength (UCS), lower failure strain and higher WOF (+5{\%}, +5{\%}, −4{\%} and +11{\%}, respectively). Compared to monolithic ZK60A (tension levels), the corresponding nanocomposite exhibited lower 0.2{\%} TYS and higher UTS, failure strain and WOF (−4{\%}, +13{\%}, +170{\%} and +200{\%}, respectively). Compared to monolithic ZK60A (compression levels), the corresponding nanocomposite exhibited lower 0.2{\%} CYS and higher UCS, failure strain and WOF (−10{\%}, +7{\%}, +15{\%} and +26{\%}, respectively). The capability of Al2O3 nanoparticles to enhance the properties of cast magnesium alloys in a way never seen before with micron length scale reinforcements is clearly demonstrated.},

@article{Chiu2009,
abstract = {Here we report a new glucose sensing electrode based on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/Prussian blue (PB) bilayer and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT). The bilayer was prepared on a flexible screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) by sequential electrodeposition. The inner PB layer was electrodeposited first for detecting H(2)O(2) from glucose oxidation; the outer PEDOT layer was electropolymerized on a baked or an unbaked PB film to entrap glucose oxidase (GOD). It was observed that the stability of PB in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) was attained by post-deposition bake at 100 degrees C and the outer PEDOT layer both. In addition, a baked PB film enhanced the subsequent PEDOT growth and the corresponding GOD entrapment. As a result, the bilayer enzyme electrode showed highly resolved and reproducible signals (R.S.D.=2.54{\%}) to glucose samples from 100 microM to 1M during a flow-injection analysis (FIA) at -0.1V vs. Ag/AgCl. The sensitivity of the linear range (1-10mM) was 2.67 microAcm(-2)mM(-1). Moreover, the electrode retained ca. 82{\%} of the original response after 1-month storage in PBS, pH 6.0 at 4 degrees C and could determine the glucose level in human serum precisely. Besides, it was found that CNT incorporation could further improve the sensitivity and could achieve muM-range glucose detection.},

@article{Ito2012,
abstract = {Photosensitized electron-transfer processes of fullerenes hybridized with electron donating or other electron accepting molecules have been surveyed in this review on the basis of the recent results reported mainly from our laboratories. Fullerenes act as photo-sensitizing electron acceptors with respect to a wide variety of electron donors; in addition, fullerenes in the ground state also act as good electron acceptors in the presence of light-absorbing electron donors such as porphyrins. With single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), the photoexcited fullerenes act as electron acceptor. In the case of triple fullerene/porphyrin/SWCNT architectures, the photoexcited porphyrins act as electron donors toward the fullerene and SWCNT. These mechanisms are rationalized with the molecular orbital considerations performed for these huge supramolecules. For the confirmation of the electron transfer processes, transient absorption methods have been used, in addition to time-resolved fluorescence spectral measurements. The kinetic data obtained in solution are found to be quite useful to predict the efficiencies of photovoltaic cells.},

@article{Ramanavicius2009,
abstract = {Polypyrrole formation initiated by UV/VIS irradiation and stabilization of (CdSe)ZnS quantum dots is reported. Presented results demonstrate that UV/VIS irradiation is slowly destructing Q-dots that decreases quantum yield and shifts peak of photoluminescence (PL) spectra to short wavelength range. The same Q-dot solution under UV/VIS light irradiation in the presence of pyrrole is more stable, there is no PL band shifts only PL intensity of Q-dot decrease. UV/VIS induced Ppy formation process in the presence/absence of Q-dots dissolved in toluene and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) not containing Q-dots was investigated. The increase in the optical absorbance in the range of 400 nm-600 nm was exploited for the monitoring of polypyrrole formation process. Results obtained proved that in the presence of UV/VIS formed polypyrrole destruction of Q-dots is much slower if compared with bare Q-dots destruction under similar conditions. However, formed polypyrrole showed no positive effect on quantum yield of Q-dot, just the opposite-polypyrrole quenched Q-dot photoluminescence. Results presented and observation by other authors on pyrrole polymerization allow to predict that by UV/VIS induced polymerization formed polypyrrole is assembling polymeric layer on heterogeneous phase between Q-dot and toluene or water (in PBS solution). Established pi-pi conjugated chain of formed polypyrrole quenches photoluminescence of Q-dot because this polymer was formed in close proximity to Q-dot surface.},

The silver nanoparticles, which are formed either by pyrolysis at 300 degrees C in an autoclave or thermolysis in xylene suspension at reflux temperature, are acting catalytically for the formation of graphite layers. Both reactions proceed through in situ reduction of the silver cations and polymerization of the central acetylene triple bonds and the exact temperature of the reaction can be monitored through DTA analysis. Interestingly, the thermal decomposition of this silver salt in xylene partly leads to a minor fraction of quasicrystalline silver, as established by HR-TEM analysis. The graphitic layers covering the silver nanoparticles are clearly seen in HR-TEM images and, furthermore, established by the presence of sp(2) carbon at the Raman spectrum of both samples.},

@article{Yang2008,
abstract = {In this report, a novel chemical synthesis of polyaniline/gold nanocomposite is explored using ionic liquid (IL) 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate. The direct chemical synthesis of polyaniline/gold nanocomposite was initiated via the spontaneous oxidation of aniline by AuCl(4) (-) in IL. A nearly uniform dispersion of polyaniline/Au particles with a diameter of 450 ± 80 nm was produced by this method, which indicates that this method is more suitable for controlling particle dimensions. It was also found that the electrical conductivity of the polyaniline/gold nanocomposite was more than 100 times higher than that of the pure polyaniline nanoparticles. The polyaniline/gold nanocomposite displays superior function in the biocatalytic activation of microperoxidase-11 because of the high surface area of the assembly and the enhanced charge transport properties of the composite material. We also report the possible application of polyaniline/gold nanocomposite as a H(2)O(2) biosensor.},

Photoluminescence studies show that there is a change in the blue/violet luminescence confirming the presence of Sn in Zn-rich composition. Present study shows that the crystalline nanocomposite nanofibers with stoichiometry of (1 - x)ZnO-(x)SnO2 (x ≤ 0.45) stabilize after the calcination and possess some morphological and optical properties that strongly depend on Sn content.},

@article{Russo2009,
abstract = {A systematic study on the anaerobic degradability of a series of starch:polyvinyl alcohol (TPS:PVOH) blends was performed to determine their fate upon disposal in either anaerobic digesters or bioreactor landfills. The aims of the study were to measure the rate and extent of solubilisation of the plastics. The extent of substrate solubilisation on a COD basis reached 60{\%} for a 90:10 (w/w) blend of TPS:PVOH, 40{\%} for 75:25, 30{\%} for 50:50 and 15{\%} for PVOH only. The rate of substrate solubilisation was most rapid for the 90:10 blend (0.041 h(-1)) and decreased with the amount of starch in the blend in the following order 0.034 h(-1)(75:25); 0.023 h(-1)(50:50). The total solids that remained after 900 h were 10 wt.{\%} (90:10); 23 wt.{\%} (75:25); 55 wt.{\%} (50:50); 90 wt.{\%} (0:100). Starch containing substrates produced a higher concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and biogas, compared to the 0:100 substrate. The major outcome was that PVOH inhibited the degradation of the starch from the blend.},

@article{Bikiaris2010,
abstract = {In the last few years, great attention has been paid to the preparation of polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) due to the tremendous enhancement of the mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical and structural properties of the pristine material. This is due to the unique combination of structural, mechanical, electrical, and thermal transport properties of CNTs. However, it is well-known that the properties of polymer-based nanocomposites strongly depend on the dispersion of nanofillers and almost all the discussed properties of PP/CNTs nanocomposites are strongly related to their microstructure. PP/CNTs nanocomposites were, mainly, prepared by melt mixing and in situ polymerization. Young's modulus, tensile strength and storage modulus of the PP/CNTs nanocomposites can be increased with increasing CNTs content due to the reinforcement effect of CNTs inside the polymer matrix. However, above a certain CNTs content the mechanical properties are reduced due to the CNTs agglomeration. The microstructure of nanocomposites has been studied mainly by SEM and TEM techniques. Furthermore, it was found that CNTs can act as nucleating agents promoting the crystallization rates of PP and the addition of CNTs enhances all other physical properties of PP. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature related to PP/CNTs nanocomposite preparation methods and properties studies.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Magnetic spindle-like Fe3O4 mesoporous nanoparticles with a length of 200 nm and diameter of 60 nm were successfully synthesized by reducing the spindle-like $\alpha$-Fe2O3 NPs which were prepared by forced hydrolysis method. The obtained samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis techniques. The results show that $\alpha$-Fe2O3 phase transformed into Fe3O4 phase after annealing in hydrogen atmosphere at 350°C. The as-prepared spindle-like Fe3O4 mesoporous NPs possess high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area up to ca. 7.9 m2 g-1. In addition, the Fe3O4 NPs present higher saturation magnetization (85.2 emu g-1) and excellent magnetic response behaviors, which have great potential applications in magnetic separation technology.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The presence of specific chemical additives in the redox electrolyte results in an efficient increase of the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The most effective additives are 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) that are adsorbed onto the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, thus shifting the semiconductor's conduction band edge and preventing recombination with triiodides. In a comparative work, we investigated in detail the action of TBP and NMBI additives in ionic liquid-based redox electrolytes with varying iodine concentrations, in order to extract the optimum additive/I2 ratio for each system. Different optimum additive/I2 ratios were determined for TBP and NMBI, despite the fact that both generally work in a similar way. Further addition of GuNCS in the optimized electrolytic media causes significant synergistic effects, the action of GuNCS being strongly influenced by the nature of the corresponding co-additive. Under the best operation conditions, power conversion efficiencies as high as 8{\%} were obtained.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The thermal conductivity of boron nitride/ethylene glycol (BN/EG) nanofluids was investigated by transient hot-wire method and two abnormal phenomena was reported. One is the abnormal higher thermal conductivity enhancement for BN/EG nanofluids at very low-volume fraction of particles, and the other is the thermal conductivity enhancement of BN/EG nanofluids synthesized with large BN nanoparticles (140 nm) which is higher than that synthesized with small BN nanoparticles (70 nm). The chain-like loose aggregation of nanoparticles is responsible for the abnormal increment of thermal conductivity enhancement for the BN/EG nanofluids at very low particles volume fraction. And the difference in specific surface area and aspect ratio of BN nanoparticles may be the main reasons for the abnormal difference between thermal conductivity enhancements for BN/EG nanofluids prepared with 140- and 70-nm BN nanoparticles, respectively.},

The effects of different levels of SHNC were studied to evaluate the moisture retention properties of sandy loam soil (sand 59{\%}, silt 21{\%}, clay 19{\%}, pH 7.4, EC 1.92 dS/m). The soil amendment with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 w/w{\%} of SHNC enhanced the moisture retention significantly at field capacity compared to the untreated soil. Besides, in a separate experiment, seed germination and seedling growth of wheat was found to be notably improved with the application of SHNC. A delay in wilting of seedlings by 5-8 days was observed for SHNC-amended soil, thereby improving wheat plant growth and establishment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reinforcement of Bis-GMA/TEGDMA dental resins (without conventional glass filler) and the corresponding composites (with conventional glass filler) containing varied mass fractions of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). METHODS: Three dispersion methods were studied to separate the silanized halloysite as individual HNTs and to uniformly distribute them into dental matrices. Photopolymerization induced volumetric shrinkage was measured by using a mercury dilatometer. Real time near infrared spectroscopy was adopted to study the degree of vinyl double bond conversion and the photopolymerization rate. Mechanical properties of the composites were tested by a universal mechanical testing machine. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the statistical analysis of the acquired data. Morphologies of halloysite/HNTs and representative fracture surfaces of the reinforced dental resins/composites were examined by SEM and TEM. RESULTS: Impregnation of small mass fractions (e.g., 1{\%} and 2.5{\%}) of the silanized HNTs in Bis-GMA/TEGDMA dental resins/composites improved mechanical properties significantly; however; large mass fractions (e.g., 5{\%}) of impregnation did not further improve the mechanical properties. The impregnation of HNTs into dental resins/composites could result in two opposite effects: the reinforcing effect due to the highly separated and uniformly distributed HNTs, and the weakening effect due to the formation of HNT agglomerates/particles. SIGNIFICANCE: Uniform distribution of a small amount of well-separated silanized HNTs into Bis-GMA/TEGDMA dental resins/composites could result in substantial improvements on mechanical properties.},

abstract = {Well-crystallized$\beta$-SiC nanorods grown on electrospun nanofibers were synthesized by carbothermal reduction of Tb doped SiO2(SiO2:Tb) nanofibers at 1,250 °C. The as-synthesized SiC nanorods were 100-300 nm in diameter and 2-3 $\mu$m in length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results suggested that the growth of the SiC nanorods should be governed by vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism with Tb metal as catalyst. Tb(NO3)3particles on the surface of the electrospun nanofibers were decomposed at 500 °C and later reduced to the formation of Tb nanoclusters at 1,200 °C, and finally the formation of a Si-C-Tb ally droplet will stimulate the VLS growth at 1,250 °C. Microstructure of the nanorod was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that SiC {\textless}111{\textgreater} is the preferred initial growth direction. The liquid droplet was identified to be Si86Tb14, which acted as effective catalyst. Strong green emissions were observed from the SiC nanorod samples. Four characteristic photoluminescence (PL) peaks of Tb ions were also identified.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A novel ultrasonic-aided one-step method for the fabrication of gold nanofluids is proposed in this study. Both spherical- and plate-shaped gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in the size range of 10-300 nm are synthesized. Subsequent purification produces well-controlled nanofluids with known solid and liquid contents. The morphology and properties of the nanoparticle and nanofluids are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering, as well as effective thermal conductivities. The ultrasonication technique is found to be a very powerful tool in engineering the size and shape of GNPs. Subsequent property measurement shows that both particle size and particle shape play significant roles in determining the effective thermal conductivity. A large increase in effective thermal conductivity can be achieved (approximately 65{\%}) for gold nanofluids using plate-shaped particles under low particle concentrations (i.e.764 $\mu$M/L).},

We find that when a chloroform solution of H2TPyP is dropwise added into an aqueous solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB] with a lower concentration, a large amount of irregular nanoarchitectures, together with a small amount of well-defined shuttle-like nanostructures, hollow nanospheres, and nanotubes, could be produced. While a moderate amount of shuttle-like nanostructures accompanied by a few irregular nanoarchitectures, solid nanospheres, and nanorods are produced when a CTAB aqueous solution in moderate concentration is employed, in contrast, a great quantity of shuttle-like nanostructures together with a negligible amount of solid nanospheres, nanofibers, and irregular nanostructures are manufactured when a high-concentration CTAB aqueous solution is involved. An explanation on the basis of the molecular geometry of H2TPyP and in terms of the intermolecular $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions between H2TPyP units, and hydrophobic interactions between CTAB and H2TPyP has been proposed. The investigation gives deep insights into the self-assembly behavior of porphyrins in an oil/water system and provides important clues concerning the design of appropriate porphyrins when related subjects are addressed. Our investigation suggests that an oil/aqueous system might be an efficient medium for producing unique organic-based nanostructures.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Morphological and optical characteristics of radio frequency-sputtered zinc aluminum oxideover porous silicon (PS) substrates were studied before and after irradiating composite filmswith 130 MeV of nickel ions at different fluences varying from 1 x 1012 to 3 x 1013 ions/cm2.The effect of irradiation on the composite structure was investigated by scanning electronmicroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescencespectroscopy. Current-voltage characteristics of ZnO-PS heterojunctions were also measured.As compared to the granular crystallites of zinc oxide layer, Al-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) layer showed a flaky structure. The PL spectrum of the pristine composite structure consists of theemission from the ZnO layer as well as the near-infrared emission from the PS substrate. Dueto an increase in the number of deep-level defects, possibly oxygen vacancies after swift ionirradiation, PS-Al-doped ZnO nanocomposites formed with high-porosity PS are shown todemonstrate a broadening in the PL emission band, leading to the white light emission. Thebroadening effect is found to increase with an increase in the ion fluence and porosity. XRDstudy revealed the relative resistance of the film against the irradiation, i.e., the irradiation ofthe structure failed to completely amorphize the structure, suggesting its possible applicationin optoelectronics and sensing applications under harsh radiation conditions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In this study, the lipophilic Cu nanoparticles were synthesized by surface modification method to improve their dispersion stability in hydrophobic organic media. The oil-based nanofluids were prepared with the lipophilic Cu nanoparticles. The transport properties, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of the nanofluids have been measured. The viscosities and thermal conductivities of the nanofluids with the surface-modified nanoparticles have higher values than the base fluids do. The composition has more significant effects on the thermal conductivity than on the viscosity. It is valuable to prepare an appropriate oil-based nanofluid for enhancing the heat-transfer capacity of a hydrophobic system. The effects of adding Cu nanoparticles on the thermal oxidation stability of the fluids were investigated by measuring the hydroperoxide concentration in the Cu/kerosene nanofluids. The hydroperoxide concentrations are observed to be clearly lower in the Cu nanofluids than in their base fluids. Appropriate amounts of metal nanoparticles added in a hydrocarbon fuel can enhance the thermal oxidation stability.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We prepared a composite electrode structure consisting of copper nanofiber-networked cobalt oxide (CuNFs@CoOx). The copper nanofibers (CuNFs) were fabricated on a substrate with formation of a network structure, which may have potential for improving electron percolation and retarding film deformation during the discharging/charging process over the electroactive cobalt oxide. Compared to bare CoOxthin-film (CoOxTF) electrodes, the CuNFs@CoOxelectrodes exhibited a significant enhancement of rate performance by at least six-fold at an input current density of 3C-rate. Such enhanced Li-ion storage performance may be associated with modified electrode structure at the nanoscale, improved charge transfer, and facile stress relaxation from the embedded CuNF network. Consequently, the CuNFs@CoOxcomposite structure demonstrated here can be used as a promising high-performance electrode for Li-ion batteries.},

Metal-polymer nanocomposite materials are becoming more popular for applications requiring low cost, high metal surface areas. Catalytic systems seem to be the most prevalent application for a wide range of metals used in polymer nanocomposites, particularly for metals like Pt, Ni, Co, and Au, with known catalytic activities. On the other hand, among the most frequently utilized techniques to prepare polymer/CNT and/or polymer/clay nanocomposites are approaches like melt mixing, solution casting, electrospinning and solid-state shear pulverization. Additionally, some of the current and potential applications of polymer/CNT and/or polymer/clay nanocomposites include photovoltaic devices, optical switches, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, aerospace and automotive materials, packaging, adhesives and coatings. This extensive review covers a broad range of articles, typically from high impact-factor journals, on most of the polymer-nanocomposites known to date: polymer/carbon nanotubes, polymer/metal nanospheres, and polymer/clay nanoplatelets composites. The various types of nanocomposites are described form the preparation stages to performance and applications. Comparisons of the various types of nanocomposites are conducted and conclusions are formulated.},

Multi-walled carbon nanotube-polypyrrole nanocomposites were synthesized by electrochemical polymerization of monomers in the presence of different amounts of MWNTs using sodium dodecylbenzensulfonate (SDBS) as surfactant at room temperature and normal pressure. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) indicates that the polymer is wrapped around the nanotubes. Measurement of the nonlinear refractive indices (n(2)) and the nonlinear absorption ($\beta$) of the samples with different MWNT concentrations measurements were performed by a single Z-scan method using continuous wave (CW) laser beam excitation wavelength of $\lambda$ = 532 nm. The results show that both nonlinear optical parameters increased with increasing the concentration of MWNTs. The third order nonlinear susceptibilities were also calculated and found to follow the same trend as n(2) and $\beta$. In addition, the conductivity of the composite film was found to increase rapidly with the increase in the MWNT concentration.},

The structure of such hybrid cell comprises of an organic active material (p-type) deposited by coating, printing or spraying technique on the surface of bulk or nanostructured semiconductor (n-type) forming a heterojunction between the two materials. Organic components include various photosensitive monomers (e.g., phtalocyanines or porphyrines), conjugated polymers, and carbon nanotubes. Mechanisms of the charge separation at the interface and their transport are discussed. Also, perspectives on the future development of such hybrid cells and comparative analysis with other classes of photovoltaics of third generation are presented.},

Electrical conductivity measurements were performed on these polymer composites using four probe technique. The addition of 2 wt.{\%} of MNTs (2 wt.{\%}, f-MWCNTs) to PVDF matrix results in an increase in the electrical conductivity from 10-16S/m to 4.5 × 10-5S/m (3.2 × 10-1S/m). Electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) was measured with vector network analyzer using waveguide sample holder in X-band frequency range. EMI SE of approximately 20 dB has been obtained with the addition of 5 wt.{\%} MNTs-1 wt.{\%} f-MWCNTs to PVDF in comparison with EMI SE of approximately 18 dB for 7 wt.{\%} of f-MWCNTs indicating the potential use of the present MNT/f-MWCNT/PVDF composite as low-cost EMI shielding materials in X-band region.},

In this study, novel fluorescent/magnetic nanoparticles were prepared and used in high-efficient cellular imaging. The nanoparticles coated with the modified chitosan possessed a magnetic oxide core and a covalently attached fluorescent dye. We evaluated the feasibility and efficiency in labeling cancer cells (SMMC-7721) with the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles exhibited a high affinity to cells, which was demonstrated by flow cytometry and magnetic resonance imaging. The results showed that cell-labeling efficiency of the nanoparticles was dependent on the incubation time and nanoparticles' concentration. The minimum detected number of labeled cells was around 10(4) by using a clinical 1.5-T MRI imager. Fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy instruments were used to monitor the localization patterns of the magnetic nanoparticles in cells. These new magneto-fluorescent nanoagents have demonstrated the potential for future medical use.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Due to the numerous applications of nanofluids, investigating and understanding of thermophysical properties of nanofluids has currently become one of the core issues. Although numerous theoretical and numerical models have been developed by previous researchers to understand the mechanism of enhanced heat transfer in nanofluids; to the best of our knowledge these models were limited to the study of either thermal conductivity or convective heat transfer of nanofluids. We have developed a numerical model which can estimate the enhancement in both the thermal conductivity and convective heat transfer in nanofluids. It also aids in understanding the mechanism of heat transfer enhancement. The study reveals that the nanoparticle dispersion in fluid medium and nanoparticle heat transport phenomenon are equally important in enhancement of thermal conductivity. However, the enhancement in convective heat transfer was caused mainly due to the nanoparticle heat transport mechanism. Ability of this model to be able to understand the mechanism of convective heat transfer enhancement distinguishes the model from rest of the available numerical models.},

abstract = {For bioanalytical systems sensitivity and biomolecule activity are critical issues. The immobilization of proteins into multilayer systems by the layer-by-layer deposition has become one of the favorite methods with this respect. Moreover, the combination of nanoparticles with biomolecules on electrodes is a matter of particular interest since several examples with high activities and direct electron transfer have been found. Our study describes the investigation on silica nanoparticles and the redox protein cytochrome c for the construction of electro-active multilayer architectures, and the electron transfer within such systems. The novelty of this work is the construction of such artificial architectures with a non-conducting building block. Furthermore a detailed study of the size influence of silica nanoparticles is performed with regard to formation and electrochemical behavior of these systems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Nanoparticles are often measured using atomic force microscopy or other scanning probe microscopy methods. For isolated nanoparticles on flat substrates, this is a relatively easy task. However, in real situations, we often need to analyze nanoparticles on rough substrates or nanoparticles that are not isolated. In this article, we present a simple model for realistic simulations of nanoparticle deposition and we employ this model for modeling nanoparticles on rough substrates. Different modeling conditions (coverage, relaxation after deposition) and convolution with different tip shapes are used to obtain a wide spectrum of virtual AFM nanoparticle images similar to those known from practice. Statistical parameters of nanoparticles are then analyzed using different data processing algorithms in order to show their systematic errors and to estimate uncertainties for atomic force microscopy analysis of nanoparticles under non-ideal conditions. It is shown that the elimination of user influence on the data processing algorithm is a key step for obtaining accurate results while analyzing nanoparticles measured in non-ideal conditions.},

@article{Fedosov2011,
abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) infected by the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf-RBCs) parasite lose their membrane deformability and they also exhibit enhanced cytoadherence to vascular endothelium and other healthy and infected RBCs. The combined effect may lead to severe disruptions of normal blood circulation due to capillary occlusions. Here we extend the adhesion model to investigate the adhesive dynamics of Pf-RBCs as a function of wall shear stress (WSS) and other parameters using a three-dimensional, multiscale RBC model. Several types of adhesive behavior are identified, including firm adhesion, flipping dynamics, and slow slipping along the wall. In particular, the flipping dynamics of Pf-RBCs observed in experiments appears to be due to the increased stiffness of infected cells and the presence of the solid parasite inside the RBC, which may cause an irregular adhesion behavior. Specifically, a transition from crawling dynamics to flipping behavior occurs at a Young's modulus approximately three times larger than that of healthy RBCs. The simulated dynamics of Pf-RBCs is in excellent quantitative agreement with available microfluidic experiments if the force exerted on the receptors and ligands by an existing bond is modeled as a nonlinear function of WSS.},

abstract = {Extrudate swell is often observed to be weakened in nanocomposites compared to the pure polymer matrix. A theory quantifying this would be significant either for optimum processing or for understanding their viscoelasticity. A unified extrudate swell correlation with material properties and capillary parameters was suggested for polymer melt and their nanocomposites when considering the reservoir entry effect. More importantly, it was the first to find that the composite swell ratio can be the matrix swell ratio multiplied by the concentration shift factor, which is similar to the dynamic moduli expression for composites. The factor is a function of the shear field (stress or shear rate), filler content, filler internal structure and the surface state as well as the matrix properties. Several sets of swell data for nanocomposites were chosen from publications to test the new theories. The proposed quantitative model displayed good fit for the five kinds of nanocomposites, which verified the rationality of the swell theory for nanocomposites.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Spherical iron oxide nanocomposite particles composed of magnetite and wustite have been successfully synthesized using a novel method of pulsed laser irradiation in ethyl acetate. Both the size and the composition of nanocomposite particles are controlled by laser irradiation condition. Through tuning the laser fluence, the Fe3O4/FeO phase ratio can be precisely controlled, and the magnetic properties of final products can also be regulated. This work presents a successful example of the fabrication of ferro (ferri) (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems with high chemical stability. The results show this novel simple method as widely extendable to various FM/AFM nanocomposite systems.},

Inorganic nanoparticles possess outstanding optical, catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, which are significantly different their bulk states. By combining the attractive functionalities of both components, nanocomposites derived from organic polymers and inorganic nanoparticles are expected to display synergistically improved properties. The potential applications of the resultant nanocomposites are various, e.g. automotive, aerospace, opto-electronics, etc. Here, we review recent progress in polymer-based inorganic nanoparticle composites.},

The P123/ACP nanocomposite is used as the nanocarrier for hydrophobic drug ibuprofen, based on the combined advantages of both amphiphilic block copolymer and calcium phosphate delivery system. The P123/ACP nanocomposite has a much higher ibuprofen loading capacity (148 mg/g) than the single-phase calcium phosphate nanostructures. The drug release percentage of the P123/ACP nanocomposite in simulated body fluid reaches about 100{\%} in a period of 156 h, which is much slower than that of single-phase calcium phosphate nanostructures. It is expected that the P123/ACP nanocomposite is promising for the application in the controlled delivery of hydrophobic drugs.},

abstract = {Platinum nanoparticle-doped chitosan (CHIT) solution can be easily prepared by treating the CHIT solution with aqueous H2PtCl6 solution followed by chemical reduction of Pt(IV) with NaBH4. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are then dispersed in the nanoparticle-doped solution. The resulting Pt-CNT-CHIT material brings new capabilities for electrochemical devices by using the synergistic action of Pt nanaoparticles and CNT. Positively charged Pt-CNT-CHIT solution and negatively charged poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) salt (PSS) have been employed to fabricate stable ultrathin multilayer films on gold electrode and quartz glass slides in a layer-by-layer fashion. Cyclic voltammetric and UV-vis adsorption spectroscopy confirms the consecutive growth of the multilayer films. The modified gold electrode allows low-potential detection of hydrogen peroxide with high sensitivity and fast response time. With the immobilization of cholesterol oxidase onto the electrode surface using glutaric dialdehyde, a biosensor that responds sensitively to cholesterol has been constructed. In pH 6.98 phosphate buffer, almost interference free determination of cholesterol has been realized at 0.1 V vs. SCE with a linear range from 0.01 to 3mM and response time{\textless}30s. With the immobilization of another cholesterol esterase enzyme layer, the biosensor was used to determine total cholesterol in serum samples with satisfactory results.},

abstract = {Among natural polymers, starch is one of the most promising biodegradable materials because it is a renewable bioresource that is universally available and of low cost. However, the properties of starch-based materials are not satisfactory. One approach is the use of nano-filler as reinforcement for starch-based materials. In this paper, a nanocomposite is prepared using ZnO nanoparticles stabilized by carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) as the filler in glycerol plasticized-pea starch (GPS) matrix by the casting process. According to the characterization of ZnO-CMC particles with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG), ZnO (about 60 wt{\%}) is encapsulated with CMC (about 40 wt{\%}) in ZnO-CMC particles with the size of about 30-40 nm. A low loading of ZnO-CMC particles can obviously improve the pasting viscosity, storage modulus, the glass transition temperature and UV absorbance of GPS/ZnO-CMC nanocomposites. When the ZnO-CMC contents vary from 0 to 5 wt{\%}, the tensile yield strength increase from 3.94 MPa to 9.81 MPa, while the elongation at break reduce from 42.2{\%} to 25.8{\%}. The water vapor permeability decrease from 4.76 x 10(-10) to 1.65 x 10(-10) g m(-1) s(-1) Pa(-1).},

To validate the model the water sorption kinetics as well as the release kinetics of three antimicrobial agents (i.e., lysozyme, nisin and sodium benzoate, all approved to be used in contact with food) were determined at ambient temperature (25 degrees C). The three investigated active agents were entrapped in four films of PVOH with a different degree of crosslink. The model was successfully used to fit all the above sets of data, corroborating the validity of the hypothesis made to derive it.},

The XRD results showed that at the content of 1.0 wt {\%} Organo Montmorillonite (OMMT) for two techniques and 3.0 wt {\%} OMMT for the in situ polymerization technique, the OMMT was well-intercalated, exfoliated and dispersed into polyimide matrix. The OMMT agglomerated when its amount exceeded 10 wt {\%} and 3.0 wt {\%} for solution-dispersion and in situ polymerization techniques respectively. These results were confirmed by the TEM images of the prepared PI/MMT NCs.

First, the background of research, development and applications on hybrid composite materials is introduced. Second, metal/polymer composite bonded structures are discussed. Then, the rationale is given for nanostructuring the interface in composite materials and structures by introducing nanoscale features such as nanopores and nanofibers. The effects of modifying matrices and nano-architecturing interfaces on the mechanical properties of nanocomposite materials are examined. A nonlinear damage model for characterizing the deformation behavior of polymeric nanocomposites is presented and the application of this model to carbon nanotube-reinforced and reactive graphite nanotube-reinforced epoxy composite materials is shown.},

The microstructure of the network is investigated by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. The multi-walled carbon nanotube network has an uniform spatial extension in the silicon nitride matrix. The current-voltage and resistance-temperature characteristics are both linear, proving the metallic behavior of the network. The I-V curves present oscillations that are further analyzed by computing the conductance-voltage characteristics. The conductance presents minima and maxima that appear at the same voltage for both bias polarities, at both 20 and 298 K, and that are not periodic. These oscillations are interpreted as due to percolation processes. The voltage percolation thresholds are identified with the conductance minima.},

@article{Debieu2011,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: In this article, the microstructure and photoluminescence (PL) properties of Nd-doped silicon-rich silicon oxide (SRSO) are reported as a function of the annealing temperature and the Nd concentration. The thin films, which were grown on Si substrates by reactive magnetron co-sputtering, contain the same Si excess as determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra show that a phase separation occurs during the annealing because of the condensation of the Si excess resulting in the formation of silicon nanoparticles (Si-np) as detected by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Under non-resonant excitation at 488 nm, our Nd-doped SRSO films simultaneously exhibited PL from Si-np and Nd3+ demonstrating the efficient energy transfer between Si-np and Nd3+ and the sensitizing effect of Si-np. Upon increasing the Nd concentration from 0.08 to 4.9 at.{\%}, our samples revealed a progressive quenching of the Nd3+ PL which can be correlated with the concomitant increase of disorder within the host matrix as shown by FTIR experiments. Moreover, the presence of Nd-oxide nanocrystals in the highest Nd-doped sample was established by XRD. It is, therefore, suggested that the Nd clustering, as well as disorder, are responsible for the concentration quenching of the PL of Nd3+.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In this study, we report the high-yield synthesis of 2-dimensional cupric oxide (CuO) nanodiscs through dehydrogenation of 1-dimensional Cu(OH)2 nanowires at 60°C. Most of the nanodiscs had a diameter of approximately 500 nm and a thickness of approximately 50 nm. After further prolonged reaction times, secondary irregular nanodiscs gradually grew vertically into regular nanodiscs. These CuO nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. The possible growth mechanism of the interlaced disc CuO nanostructures is systematically discussed. The electrochemical performances of the CuO nanodisc electrodes were evaluated in detail using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes enables the enhanced reversible capacities and capacity retention of CuO nanodisc electrodes on cycling by offering more efficient electron transport paths.},

This review aims to discuss experimental techniques of the proposed method and its advantages over other developed methods.},

abstract = {An electrochemical sensor for p-aminophenyl phosphate (pAPP) is reported. It is based on the electrochemical conversion of 4-aminophenol (4AP) at a quantum dot (QD) modified electrode under illumination. Without illumination no electron transfer and thus no oxidation of 4AP can occur. pAPP as substrate is converted by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to generate 4AP as a product. The QDs are coupled via 1,4-benzenedithiol (BDT) linkage to the surface of a gold electrode and thus allow potential-controlled photocurrent generation. The photocurrent is modified by the enzyme reaction providing access to the substrate detection. In order to develop a photobioelectrochemical sensor the enzyme is immobilized on top of the photo-switchable layer of the QDs. Immobilization of ALP is required for the potential possibility of spatially resolved measurements. Geometries with immobilized ALP are compared versus having the ALP in solution. Data indicate that functional immobilization with layer-by-layer assembly is possible. Enzymatic activity of ALP and thus the photocurrent can be described by Michaelis- Menten kinetics. pAPP is detected as proof of principle investigation within the range of 25 $\mu$M-1 mM.},

Using small-angle neutrons scattering experiments, we determined the evolution of the static structure factor of the suspensions when an electric field is applied. Experimental data were fitted with model calculations using the Percus-Yevick solution for Baxter's hard-sphere adhesive potential. The obtained stickiness parameter is directly related to the polarization interactions that depend on the water content of silica particles. The influence of the polarization interparticle potential on the rheology of the silica dispersions was investigated in a second time. A microscopic theory for the shear viscosity of adhesive hard-sphere suspensions was successfully used which describes the steady shear viscosity of suspension in terms of the fractal concept.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview on structural assessment of nanocomposite materials. First of all, a brief description of advanced structure characterization methods such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy is presented. Secondly, applications of these methods for analysis of structures and compositions of typical nanocomposites are introduced. The nanocomposites are formed by different nanoscale processing technologies. Electrochemically polymerized polyaniline (PANi) nanocomposites, thermomechanically processed metal matrix nanocomposites, nanocast ceramic matrix composites are typical examples discussed in this paper. Case studies on several functional nanocomposites for energy storage/conversion, catalysis and sensing applications are mentioned. After that, assessment of the interface structures of nanocomposite materials using surface characterization techniques and mechanical damage models is discussed. Finally, concluding remarks are provided.},

With the introduction of the Co-MgO particles, the dielectric constant of the material slightly increases and the storage modulus decreases with respect to the values obtained for the pure polymer.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered potential biomedical materials because of their flexible structure and propensity for chemical functionalization. In the first part of this two-part review we focus on the properties and use of CNTs as building blocks for novel drug delivery systems, dosage forms, and biomedical substrates. Pharmaceutical excipients have been regarded as inert or nonactive components of dosage forms, but they are essential and necessary components of pharmaceutical preparations. Here we present a collection of data to initiate the description of CNTs as pharmaceutical excipients. We summarize the synthesis, purification, and analysis of CNTs related to their pharmaceutical properties and quality control. Application of CNTs in biological systems depends on their compatibility with hydrophilic environments; therefore, the solubilization of CNTs in pharmaceutical solvents is essential. Furthermore, because it is becoming increasingly important that the relevant chemical, physiochemical, and pharmaceutical properties of CNTs be identified, we have prepared a "mini-monograph" of CNTs that compiles their pertinent properties.},

Carbonyl chloride terminal chain ends were generated using 1{\%} extra sebacoyl chloride that could interact chemically with the organoclay. The distribution of clay in the nanocomposites was investigated by XRD, SEM, and TEM. Mechanical and thermal properties of these materials were monitored using tensile testing, TGA, and DSC. The results revealed delaminated and intercalated nanostructures leading to improved tensile strength and modulus up to 6 wt{\%} addition of organoclay. The elongation at break and toughness of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing clay contents. The nanocomposites were thermally stable in the range 400-450 °C. The glass transition temperature increased relative to the neat polyamide due to the interfacial interactions between the two phases. Water uptake of the hybrids decreased upon the addition of organoclay depicting reduced permeability.},

The measured hole drift mobilities are analyzed in the context of B{\"{a}}ssler's Gaussian disorder model and the correlated disorder model in order to determine the polymer internal morphology of hybrid nanocomposite thin films.

The corresponding disorder parameters indicate increasing disruption of interchain interaction with increasing CQD concentration.

abstract = {This work reviews the use of porous silicon (PS) as a nanomaterial which is extensively investigated and utilized for various applications, e.g., in the fields of optics, sensor technology and biomedicine. Furthermore the combination of PS with one or more materials which are also nanostructured due to their deposition within the porous matrix is discussed. Such nanocompounds offer a broad avenue of new and interesting properties depending on the kind of involved materials as well as on their morphology. The filling of the pores performed by electroless or electrochemical deposition is described, whereas different morphologies, reaching from micro- to macro pores are utilized as host material which can be self-organized or fabricated by prestructuring. For metal-deposition within the porous structures, both ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metals are used. Emphasis will be put on self-arranged mesoporous silicon, offering a quasi-regular pore arrangement, employed as template for filling with ferromagnetic metals. By varying the deposition parameters the precipitation of the metal structures within the pores can be tuned in geometry and spatial distribution leading to samples with desired magnetic properties. The correlation between morphology and magnetic behaviour of such semiconducting/magnetic systems will be determined. Porous silicon and its combination with a variety of filling materials leads to nanocomposites with specific physical properties caused by the nanometric size and give rise to a multiplicity of potential applications in spintronics, magnetic and magneto-optic devices, nutritional food additives as well as drug delivery.},

Great interest has been generated in building highly sensitive strain sensors with these new nanocomposites. This article reviews the recent significant developments in the field of highly sensitive strain sensors made from CNT/polymer nanocomposites. We focus on the following two topics: electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of CNT/polymer nanocomposites, and the relationship between them by considering the internal conductive network formed by CNTs, tunneling effect, aspect ratio and piezoresistivity of CNTs themselves, etc. Many recent experimental, theoretical and numerical studies in this field are described in detail to uncover the working mechanisms of this new type of strain sensors and to demonstrate some possible key factors for improving the sensor sensitivity.},

The optimum initiation time and grafting reaction temperature were found to be 15min and 30 degrees C, respectively. The silver nanoparticles were loaded into grafted filter paper by equilibration in silver nitrate solution followed by citrate reduction. The formation of silver nanoparticles has been confirmed by TEM and SAED analysis. The novel nano silver loaded filter paper has been investigated for its antimicrobial properties against E.coli. This newly developed material shows strong antibacterial property and thus offers its candidature for possible use as antibacterial food-packaging material.},

The goal was to identify food applications that are more likely and food applications that are less likely to be accepted by the public. The psychometric paradigm was employed, and applications were described in short scenarios. Results suggest that affect and perceived control are important factors influencing risk and benefit perception. Nanotechnology food packaging was assessed as less problematic than nanotechnology foods. Analyses of individual data showed that the importance of naturalness in food products and trust were significant factors influencing the perceived risk and the perceived benefit of nanotechnology foods and nanotechnology food packaging.},

abstract = {A simple, sensitive method for the speciation of inorganic antimony by cloud point extraction combined with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) is presented and evaluated. The method based on the fact that formation of a hydrophobic complex of antimony(III) with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) at pH 5.0 and subsequently the hydrophobic complex enter into surfactant-rich phase, whereas antimony(V) remained in aqueous solutions. Antimony(III) in surfactant-rich phase was analyzed by ETAAS after dilution by 0.2 mL nitric acid in methanol (0.1M), and antimony(V) was calculated by subtracting antimony(III) from the total antimony after reducing antimony(V) to antimony(III) by l-cysteine. The main factors affecting the cloud point extraction, such as pH, concentration of APDC and Triton X-114, equilibrium temperature and incubation time, sample volume were investigated in detail. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limit (3 sigma) of the proposed method was 0.02 ng mL(-1) for antimony(III), and the relative standard deviation was 7.8{\%} (c=1.0 ng mL(-1), n=7). The proposed method was successfully applied to speciation of inorganic antimony in the leaching solutions of different food packaging materials with satisfactory results.},

abstract = {This paper represents a short overview of nanocomposites consisting of magnetic nanoparticles incorporated into the pores of a porous silicon matrix by two different methods. On the one hand, nickel is electrochemically deposited whereas the nanoparticles are precipitated on the pore walls. The size of these particles is between 
2 and 6 nm. These particles cover the pore walls and form a tube-like arrangement. On the other hand, rather well monodispersed iron oxide nanoparticles, of 5 and 8 nm respectively, are infiltrated into the pores. From their size the particles would be superparamagnetic if isolated but due to magnetic interactions between them, ordering of magnetic moments occurs below a blocking temperature and thus the composite system displays a ferromagnetic behavior. This transition temperature of the nanocomposite can be varied by changing the filling factor of the particles within the pores. Thus samples with magnetic properties which are variable in a broad range can be achieved, which renders this composite system interesting not only for basic research but also for applications, especially because of the silicon base material which makes it possible for today's process technology.},

The simple optical method for the visualization of enzyme on the surfaces is based on the enzymic formation of polypyrrole. The activity of the enzyme was quantified via enzymic formation of polypyrrole, which was detected and investigated by quartz microbalance and amperometric techniques.

The obtained samples were characterized by adsorption of N2 at -196°C, temperature-programmed desorption and determination of pH at the point of zero charge. CNT/poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites were prepared using the above CNT samples, with different filler fractions up to 1 wt{\%}. It was found that oxidation reduced composite conductivity for a given concentration, shifted the percolation threshold to higher concentrations, and had no significant effect in the dielectric response.},

@article{Picard2007,
abstract = {Organically modified montmorillonites obtained by cation exchange from the same natural layered silicate were studied. The surface properties of the pristine and a series of organically modified clays were determined by inverse gas chromatography and the water adsorption mechanisms were studied by a gravimetric technique coupled with a microcalorimeter. A significant increase of the specific surface area, a decrease of the water adsorption, and a decrease of the dispersive component of the surface energy were observed when the sodium cations of the natural montmorillonite were exchanged for a quaternary ammonium. Slighter differences in surface properties were observed, on the other hand, between the different types of organically modified montmorillonites. Indeed, similar dispersive components of the surface energy were determined on the organoclays. Nevertheless, the specific surface area increased in the range 48-80 m(2)/g with increasing d-spacing values and the presence of specific groups attached to the quaternary ammonium, such as phenyl rings or hydroxyl groups, led to some specific behaviors, i.e., a more pronounced base character and a higher water adsorption at high activity, respectively. Differences in interlayer cation chain organization, denoted as crystallinity, were also observed as a function of the nature of the chains borne by the quaternary ammonium. In a later step, polyethylene-based nanocomposites were prepared with those organically modified montmorillonites. The clay dispersion and the barrier properties of the nanocomposites were discussed as a function of the montmorillonite characteristics and of the matrix/montmorillonite interactions expected from surface energy characterization.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Very large thermal conductivity enhancement had been reported earlier in colloidal suspensions of solid nanoparticles (i.e., nanofluids) and more recently also in oil-in-water emulsions. In this study, nanoemulsions of alcohol and polyalphaolefin (PAO) are spontaneously generated by self-assembly, and their thermal conductivity and viscosity are investigated experimentally. Alcohol and PAO have similar thermal conductivity values, so that the abnormal effects, such as particle Brownian motion, on thermal transport could be deducted in these alcohol/PAO nanoemulsion fluids. Small angle neutron-scattering measurement shows that the alcohol droplets are spheres of 0.8-nm radius in these nanoemulsion fluids. Both thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of the fluids are found to increase with alcohol droplet loading, as expected from classical theories. However, the measured conductivity increase is very moderate, e.g., a 2.3{\%} increase for 9 vol{\%}, in these fluids. This suggests that no anomalous enhancement of thermal conductivity is observed in the alcohol/PAO nanoemulsion fluids tested in this study.},

Entrapment of ZnO NPs was controlled via different conditions of SMNW fabrication such as an applied potential and mixture ratio of NPs and aniline solution. The controlled concentration of ZnO NP results in changes in the physical properties of the SMNWs, as shown in transmission electron microscopy images. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and elasticity of SMNWs show improvement over those of pure polyaniline nanowire. The new nano-multicomposite material showed synergistic effects on mechanical and electrical properties, with logarithmical change and saturation increasing ZnO NP concentration.},

The kinetics of the film oxidation and the structural properties of the prepared samples were investigated by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The electrical properties of the selected SiO2:Me nanocomposite films were evaluated by measuring C-V and I-V characteristics on a metal-oxide-semiconductor stack. It is found that Me segregation induced by Si:Me mixture oxidation results in the formation of a high density of Me and silicide nanocrystals in thin film SiO2 matrix. Strong evidence of oxidation temperature as well as impurity type effect on the charge storage in crystalline Me-nanodot layer is demonstrated by the hysteresis behavior of the high-frequency C-V curves.},

abstract = {The shear flow dynamics of reversible red cell aggregates in dense suspensions were investigated by ultrasound scattering, to study the shear disruption processes of Rayleigh clusters and examine the effective mean field approximation used in microrheological models. In a first section, a rheo-acoustical model, in the Rayleigh scattering regime, is proposed to describe the shear stress dependence of the low frequency scattered power in relation to structural parameters. The fractal scattering regime characterizing the anisotropic scattering from flocs of size larger than the ultrasound wavelength is further discussed. In the second section, we report flow-dependent changes in the low-frequency scattering coefficient in a plane-plane flow geometry to analyze the shear disruption processes of hardened or deformable red cell aggregates in neutral dextran polymer solution. Rheo-acoustical experiments are examined on the basis of the rheo-acoustical model and the effective medium approximation. The ability of ultrasound scattering technique to determine the critical disaggregation shear stress and to give quantitative information on particle surface adhesive energy is analyzed. Lastly, the shear-thinning behavior of weakly aggregated hardened or deformable red cells is described.},

abstract = {This review aims to present recent advances in the synthesis and structure characterization as well as the properties of polymer layered silicate nanocomposites. The advent of polymer layered silicate nanocomposites has revolutionized research into polymer composite materials. Nanocomposites are organic-inorganic hybrid materials in which at least one dimension of the filler is less than 100 nm. A number of synthesis routes have been developed in the recent years to prepare these materials, which include intercalation of polymers or pre-polymers from solution, in-situ polymerization, melt intercalation etc. The nanocomposites where the filler platelets can be dispersed in the polymer at the nanometer scale owing to the specific filler surface modifications, exhibit significant improvement in the composite properties, which include enhanced mechanical strength, gas barrier, thermal stability, flame retardancy etc. Only a small amount of filler is generally required for the enhancement in the properties, which helps the composite materials retain transparency and low density.},

The composite obtained was characterized by BET surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-vis analysis. A methyl orange (MO) solution under visible light irradiation was used to determine the photocatalytic activity. Excellent photocatalytic degradation of a MO solution was observed using the WO3-fullerene, fullerene-TiO2, and WO3-fullerene/TiO2 composites under visible light. An increase in photocatalytic activity was observed, and WO3-fullerene/TiO2 has the best photocatalytic activity; it may attribute to the increase of the photo-absorption effect by the fullerene and the cooperative effect of the WO3.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We report on the use of the self-organization process of sputtered gold nanoparticles on a self-assembled block copolymer film deposited by horizontal precipitation Langmuir-Blodgett (HP-LB) method. The morphology and the phase-separation of a film of poly-n-butylacrylate-block-polyacrylic acid (PnBuA-b-PAA) were studied at the nanometric scale by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The templating capability of the PnBuA-b-PAA phase-separated film was studied by sputtering gold nanoparticles (NPs), forming a film of nanometric thickness. The effect of the polymer chain mobility onto the organization of gold nanoparticle layer was assessed by heating the obtained hybrid PnBuA-b-PAA/Au NPs bilayer at T {\textgreater}Tg. The nanoparticles' distribution onto the different copolymer domains was found strongly affected by the annealing treatment, showing a peculiar memory effect, which modifies the AFM phase response of the Au NPs layer onto the polar domains, without affecting their surfacial composition. The effect is discussed in terms of the peculiar morphological features induced by enhanced mobility of polymer chains on the Au NPs layer.},

For this luteolin and kaempferol were electrochemically polymerized on glassy carbon (GC) electrode surface in order to get polyluteolin and polykaempferol-modified glassy carbon electrodes (PolyLut/GC and PolyKae/GC, correspondingly). The formation of polyphenol layer on the GC electrode surface was evidenced by atomic force microscopy. Square wave voltammetry was found to be more sensitive in comparison with differential pulse voltammetry. It was determined that PolyLut/GC and PolyKae/GC electrodes offered great sensitivity towards Cu(II) ions with very low limit of detection, good reproducibility, sufficient stability and excellent selectivity of analytical signal.},

abstract = {This research aimed to monitor the amounts of PFOS and PFOA in food packaging and study the migration of PFOS and PFOA from food packaging, using a saliva simulant and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) technique. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed to determine residues of PFOS and PFOA by using a gradient reversed-phase method with ammonium acetate/acetonitrile buffer. A good linearity was established for PFOS and PFOA in a range of 0.05-10 $\mu$gL(-1), with R2 ≥ 0.9998. Of the samples extracted by methanol, the highest concentration of PFOS was found in fast-food container samples, at a level of 92.48 ng dm(-2). For PFOA, the highest concentration in samples extracted by methanol was found in ice cream cup samples, at a level of 16.91 ng dm(-2). The amounts of PFOS and PFOA that migrated from food packaging samples through contact with saliva simulant were 4.80 and 4.55 ng dm(-2), respectively. Saliva simulant could leach PFOS and PFOA from the group of the thickest paper samples (≤1 dm2 g(-1)) at levels of 7.01 and 6.41 ng dm(-2), respectively, indicating that paper with greater thickness and less area might release larger quantities of coated/added PFOS or PFOA.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A new functionalised graphene sheet (FGS) filled poly(dimethyl)siloxane insulator nanocomposite has been developed with high dielectric constant, making it well suited for applications in flexible electronics. The dielectric permittivity increased tenfold at 10 Hz and 2 wt.{\%} FGS, while preserving low dielectric losses and good mechanical properties. The presence of functional groups on the graphene sheet surface improved the compatibility nanofiller/polymer at the interface, reducing the polarisation process. This study demonstrates that functionalised graphene sheets are ideal nanofillers for the development of new polymer composites with high dielectric constant values.PACS: 78.20.Ci, 72.80.Tm, 62.23.Kn.},

@article{Winder2002,
abstract = {This paper reports a questionnaire survey of shoppers at four supermarket stores in the UK. Regression analyses were used to determine factors in consumer complaints with the packaging of food and drink products. Neuroticism and treatment in hospital for an accident involving packaging in the last 3 years were significant associates. Analyses on who was most likely to suffer accidents or injuries while opening food and drink packaging indicated that handedness (that is, being left handed made accidents more likely) and scoring low on a measure of personal control during decision-making were significant associates. Analyses on who suffered the most serious accidents and injuries whilst opening food and drink packaging revealed that the decision-making style of social resistance (that is, the extent to which you resist asking for help from others) was related to susceptibility to the most severe accidents. These findings imply that individual factors (including both personal characteristics and personality traits) should be taken into account when considering the openability of packaging. The results of this study indicate that manufacturers should ensure that novel packaging closures have been tested on left handers in order to discover any unique difficulties for this sub-group, that packaging opening tools specifically for left-handed people should be made available and that manufacturers of packaging should always look at a 'worst case scenario' for their packaging closures as it is evident that some people will continue to struggle with difficult packaging until either they open it or they have injured themselves.},

abstract = {As an electrical energy storage device, supercapacitor finds attractive applications in consumer electronic products and alternative power source due to its higher energy density, fast discharge/charge time, low level of heating, safety, long-term operation stability, and no disposable parts. This work reviews the recent development of supercapacitor based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their composites. The purpose is to give a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of carbon nanotubes-related supercapacitor materials and to find ways for the improvement in the performance of supercapacitor. We first discussed the effects of physical and chemical properties of pure carbon nanotubes, including size, purity, defect, shape, functionalization, and annealing, on the supercapacitance. The composites, including CNTs/oxide and CNTs/polymer, were further discussed to enhance the supercapacitance and keep the stability of the supercapacitor by optimally engineering the composition, particle size, and coverage.},

abstract = {A novel heat-sealing performance is achieved by polyethylene (PE) nanocomposites reinforced by ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and montmorillonite (MMT). Appropriate nanocomposite design leads to hermetic seals with a general peelable/easy-open character across the broadest possible sealing temperature range. Observations of the fracture seal surfaces by infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy reveal that this behavior originates from a synergistic effect of the EVA copolymer and the montmorillonite clay nanofiller. Namely, the combination of EVA-copolymers and MMT nanofillers provides sufficiently favorable interactions for nanocomposite formation and mechanical robustness, but weak enough interfacial adhesion to promote a general cohesive failure of the sealant at the EVA/MMT interfaces.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The synthesis of polymer-stabilized nanoparticles (PSNPs) can be successfully carried out using intermatrix synthesis (IMS) technique, which consists in sequential loading of the functional groups of a polymer with the desired metal ions followed by nanoparticles (NPs) formation stage. After each metal-loading-NPs-formation cycle, the functional groups of the polymer appear to be regenerated. This allows for repeating the cycles to increase the NPs content or to obtain NPs with different structures and compositions (e.g. core-shell or core-sandwich). This article reports the results on the further development of the IMS technique. The formation of NPs has been shown to proceed by not only the metal reduction reaction (e.g. Cu0-NPs) but also by the precipitation reaction resulting in the IMS of PSNPs of metal salts (e.g. CuS-NPs).},

The Ni NPs embedded in silica matrix have been prepared by atom beam sputtering technique and subsequent annealing. The elongation of Ni NPs due to interaction with Au+9 ions as investigated by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows a strong dependence on initial Ni particle size and is explained on the basis of thermal spike model. Irradiation induces a change from single crystalline nature of spherical particles to polycrystalline nature of elongated particles. Magnetization measurements indicate that changes in coercivity (Hc) and remanence ratio (Mr/Ms) are stronger in the ion beam direction due to the preferential easy axis of elongated particles in the beam direction.},

abstract = {We present a 'universal' phenomenon of mass accumulation and its sensing on nanostructures due to electron beam cracking of residual gas molecules during electron beam scanning. Though the extent of this phenomenon is limited to a very small increment in mass or thickness, it has significant implications for both the scientific and technological aspects of almost all processes in the nanodomain. Mass accumulation in every frame scan (or per second) is of the order of a few attograms and the thickness of deposition is of the order of picometre (fraction of a monolayer) only. Direct measurement of a mass or thickness of this order is difficult. Nanopillars having a high resonance 'Q-factor' have been successfully exploited for such high precision measurements. The mass accumulation rate has been characterized with respect to (i) electron energy and beam current, (ii) environment within the chamber (presence or absence of a precursor gas) and (iii) partial exposure of the nanopillars to the e-beam.},

Most of the nanodiscs had a diameter of approximately 500 nm and a thickness of approximately 50 nm. After further prolonged reaction times, secondary irregular nanodiscs gradually grew vertically into regular nanodiscs. These CuO nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. The possible growth mechanism of the interlaced disc CuO nanostructures is systematically discussed. The electrochemical performances of the CuO nanodisc electrodes were evaluated in detail using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes enables the enhanced reversible capacities and capacity retention of CuO nanodisc electrodes on cycling by offering more efficient electron transport paths.},

abstract = {Nanotechnology has the potential to profoundly transform the nature of cancer diagnosis and cancer patient management in the future. Over the past decade, quantum dots (QDs) have become one of the fastest growing areas of research in nanotechnology. QDs are fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles suitable for multiplexed in vitro and in vivo imaging. Numerous studies on QDs have resulted in major advancements in QD surface modification, coating, biocompatibility, sensitivity, multiplexing, targeting specificity, as well as important findings regarding toxicity and applicability. For in vitro applications, QDs can be used in place of traditional organic fluorescent dyes in virtually any system, outperforming organic dyes in the majority of cases. In vivo targeted tumor imaging with biocompatible QDs has recently become possible in mouse models. With new advances in QD technology such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, synthesis of smaller size non-Cd based QDs, improved surface coating and conjugation, and multifunctional probes for multimodality imaging, it is likely that human applications of QDs will soon be possible in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Polymer nanocomposites show unique properties combining the advantages of the inorganic nanofillers and the organic polymers. The mesoporous silica nanofillers have received much attention due to their ordered structure, high surface area and ease for functionalization of the nanopores. To accommodate macromolecules, the nanopores lead to unusually intimate interactions between the polymer and the inorganic phase, and some unusual properties can be observed, when compared with nonporous fillers. Whereas many review articles have been devoted to polymer/nonporous nanofiller nanocomposites, few review articles focus on polymer/mesoporous silica nanocomposites. This review summarizes the recent development in the methods for synthesizing polymer/mesoporous silica nanocomposites based on the papers published from 1998 to 2009, and some unique properties of these composites are also described.},

abstract = {Cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (CoNP) can be easily prepared by mixing hexacyanoferrate and cobalt chloride solution at room temperature. The nanoparticles were solubilized in aqueous solution of a biopolymer chitosan (CHIT). With the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNT), the CoNP-CNT-CHIT system formed shows synergy between CNT and CoNP with the significant improvement of redox activity of CoNP due to the excellent electron-transfer ability of CNT. The CoNP-CNT-CHIT film modified glassy carbon electrode allows low potential detection of hydrogen peroxide with high sensitivity and fast response time. In particular, with the introduction of CNT, it amplified the H2O2 sensitivity by approximately 70 times compared to film of CoNP-CHIT. With the immobilization of glucose oxidase onto the electrode surface using glutaric dialdehyde, a biosensor that responds sensitively to glucose has been constructed. In pH 6.98 phosphate buffer, interference free determination of glucose has been realized at -0.2V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE) with a linear range from 0.01 to 10 mM and response time{\textless}10s. The detection limit was 5 microM glucose (S/N=3).},

abstract = {Chitosan (CHIT) scaffolds doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were fabricated and evaluated for their utility as a microbial fuel cell (MFC) anodic material. High resolution microscopy verified the ability of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to directly colonize CHIT-CNT scaffolds. Cross-linking agents 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC), glutaraldehyde and glyoxal were independently studied for their ability to strengthen the CHIT-CNT matrix without disrupting the final pore structure. 2.5 vol{\%} glyoxal was found to be the optimal cross-linker in terms of porosity (BET surface area=30.2 m(2) g(-1)) and structural stability. Glyoxyl and EDC cross-linked CHIT-CNT scaffolds were then studied for their ability to transfer electrons to underlying glassy carbon. Results showed an open circuit cell voltage of 600 mV and a maximum power density of 4.75 W/m(3) at a current density of 16 A/m(3) was achieved in non stirred batch mode, which compares well with published data using carbon felt electrodes where a power density of 3.5 W/m(3) at a current density of 7 A/m(3) have been reported. Additionally, CHIT-CNT scaffolds were impregnated into carbon felt electrodes and these results suggest that CHIT-CNT scaffolds can be successfully integrated with multiple support materials to create hybrid electrode materials. Further, preliminary tests indicate that the integrated scaffolds offer a robust macroporous electrode material that can be used in flow-through configurations.},

abstract = {The intercalation of cetirizine into two types of layered double hydroxides, Zn/Al and Mg/Al, has been investigated by the ion exchange method to form CTZAN and CTMAN nanocomposites, respectively. The basal spacing of the nanocomposites were expanded to 31.9 {\AA} for CTZAN and 31.2 {\AA} for CTMAN, suggesting that cetirizine anion was intercalated into Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and arranged in a tilted bilayer fashion. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) study supported the formation of both the nanocomposites, and the intercalated cetirizine is thermally more stable than its counterpart in free state. The loading of cetirizine in the nanocomposite was estimated to be about 57.2{\%} for CTZAN and 60.7{\%} CTMAN. The cetirizine release from the nanocomposites show sustained release manner and the release rate of cetirizine from CTZAN and CTMAN nanocomposites at pH 7.4 is remarkably lower than that at pH 4.8, presumably due to the different release mechanism. The inhibition of histamine release from RBL2H3 cells by the free cetirizine is higher than the intercalated cetirizine both in CTZAN and CTMAN nanocomposites. The viability in human Chang liver cells at 1000 $\mu$g/mL for CTZAN and CTMAN nanocomposites are 74.5 and 91.9{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Layer-by-layer assembly of glucose oxidase (GOx) with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is achieved on the electrode surface based on the electrostatic attraction between positively charged GOx in pH 3.8 buffer and negatively charged carboxylic groups of CNTs. The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to characterize the formation of multilayer films. In deaerated buffer solutions, the cyclic voltammetry of the multilayer films of {\{}GOx/CNT{\}}(n) shows two pairs of well-behaved redox peaks that are assigned to the redox reactions of CNTs and GOx, respectively, confirming the effective immobilization of GOx on CNTs using the layer-by-layer technique. The redox peak currents of GOx increase linearly with the increased number of layers indicating the uniform growth of GOx in multilayer films. The dependence of the cyclic voltammetric response of GOx in multilayer films on the scan rate and pH is also studied. A linear decrease of the reduction current of oxygen at the {\{}GOx/CNT{\}}-modified electrodes with the addition of glucose suggests that such multilayer films of GOx retain the bioactivity and can be used as reagentless glucose biosensors.},

In addition, interaction of hydrogel-magnetic nanoparticles with microorganisms was studied. The possibility of precise nanoparticles size control, as long as the availability of bio-compatible covering, makes them suitable for biomedical applications.},

A facile procedure is demonstrated for controlling the morphology and thickness of PPy film by adding ethanol in the reaction system and a possible mechanism of the coating formation process is proposed. The coated PPy films can be easily tuned by adding ethanol and adjusting a mass ratio of pyrrole to MWCNTs. Moreover, the thickness of PPy significantly influences the electronic conductivity and capacitive behavior of the PPy/MWCNT composites. The method may provide a facile strategy for tailoring the polymer coating on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for carbon-based device applications.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In this study we investigate the electronic transport, the optical properties, and photocurrent in two-dimensional arrays of silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) embedded in silicon dioxide, grown on quartz and having sizes in the range between less than 2 and 20 nm. Electronic transport is determined by the collective effect of Coulomb blockade gaps in the Si NCs. Absorption spectra show the well-known upshift of the energy bandgap with decreasing NC size. Photocurrent follows the absorption spectra confirming that it is composed of photo-generated carriers within the Si NCs. In films containing Si NCs with sizes less than 2 nm, strong quantum confinement and exciton localization are observed, resulting in light emission and absence of photocurrent. Our results show that Si NCs are useful building blocks of photovoltaic devices for use as better absorbers than bulk Si in the visible and ultraviolet spectral range. However, when strong quantum confinement effects come into play, carrier transport is significantly reduced due to strong exciton localization and Coulomb blockade effects, thus leading to limited photocurrent.},

The resulting PtNW-CNT-CHIT material brings capabilities for utilizing synergic action of PtNWs and CNTs to facilitate electron-transfer process in electrochemical sensor design. The PtNW-CNT-CHIT film modified electrode offered a significant decrease in the overvoltage for the hydrogen peroxide and showed to be excellent amperometric sensors for hydrogen peroxide at -0.1 V over a wide range of concentrations, and the sensitivity is 260 microAmM-1cm-2. As an application example, by linking glucose oxidase (GOx), an amplified biosensor toward glucose was prepared. The glucose biosensor exhibits a selective determination of glucose at -0.1 V with a linear response range of 5 x 10(-6) to 1.5 x 10(-2)M with a correlation coefficient of 0.997, and response time {\textless}10s. The high sensitivity of the glucose biosensor is up to 30 microAmM-1cm-2 and the detection limit was 3 microM. The biosensor displays rapid response and expanded linear response range, and excellent repeatability and stability.},

A series of different mass compositions of CdS with Ia and IIa ranging from 0.1:1.0 to 1.0:1.0 (w/w) were prepared and characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Polarizing Optical Microscopy (POM) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Photoluminescence Spectroscopy (PL). XRD showed that the broad peaks are ascribed to the formation of cubic CdS nanoparticles in both Ia and IIa. The average particle size for both nanocomposites was less than 5 nm with a narrower size distribution when compared with pure CdS nanoparticles. The analyses from POM and DSC demonstrated that mass composition from 0.1:1.0 up to 0.5:1.0 of CdS:Ia nanocomposites showed their enantiotropic nematic phase. On the other hand, polarizing optical microscopy (POM) for IIa nanocomposites showed that the liquid crystal property vanished completely when the mass composition was at 0.2:1.0. PL emissions for CdS: Ia or IIa nanocomposites indicated deep trap defects occurred in these both samples. The PL results revealed that addition of CdS to Ia monomers suppressed the photoluminescence intensity of Ia. However, the introduction of CdS to IIa monomers increased the photoluminescence and was at a maximum when the mass composition was 0.3:1.0, then decreased in intensity as more CdS was added. The XPS results also showed that the stoichiometric ratios of S/Cd were close to 1.0:1.0 for both types of nanocomposites for a mass composition of 1.0:1.0 (CdS:matrix).},

abstract = {Utilization of metallic nanoparticles in various biotechnological and medical applications represents one of the most extensively investigated areas of the current materials science. These advanced applications require the appropriate chemical functionalization of the nanoparticles with organic molecules or their incorporation in suitable polymer matrices. The intensified interest in polymer nanocomposites with silver nanoparticles is due to the high antimicrobial effect of nanosilver as well as the unique characteristics of polymers which include their excellent structural uniformity, multivalency, high degree of branching, miscellaneous morphologies and architectures, and highly variable chemical composition. In this review, we explore several aspects of antimicrobial polymer silver nanocomposites, giving special focus to the critical analysis of the reported synthetic routes including their advantages, drawbacks, possible improvements, and real applicability in antibacterial and antifungal therapy. A special attention is given to "green" synthetic routes exploiting the biopolymeric matrix and to the methods allowing preparing magnetically controllable antimicrobial polymers for targeting to an active place. The controversial mechanism of the action of silver against bacteria, fungi and yeasts as well as perspectives and new applications of silver polymeric nanocomposites is also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Recently, important efforts have been dedicated to the realization of a fascinating class of new photonic materials or metamaterials, known as photonic quasicrystals (PQCs), in which the lack of the translational symmetry is compensated by rotational symmetries not achievable by the conventional periodic crystals. As ever, more advanced functionality is demanded and one strategy is the introduction of non-linear and/or active functionality in photonic materials. In this view, core/shell nanorods (NRs) are a promising active material for light-emitting applications. In this article a two-dimensional (2D) hybrid a 2D octagonal PQC which consists of air rods in an organic/inorganic nanocomposite is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The nanocomposite was prepared by incorporating CdSe/CdS core/shell NRs into a polymer matrix. The PQC was realized by electron beam lithography (EBL) technique. Scanning electron microscopy, far field diffraction and spectra measurements are used to characterize the experimental structure. The vertical extraction of the light, by the coupling of the modes guided by the PQC slab to the free radiation via Bragg scattering, consists of a narrow red emissions band at 690 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 21.5 nm. The original characteristics of hybrid materials based on polymers and colloidal NRs, able to combine the unique optical properties of the inorganic moiety with the processability of the host matrix, are extremely appealing in view of their technological impact on the development of new high performing optical devices such as organic light-emitting diodes, ultra-low threshold lasers, and non-linear devices.PACS: 81.07.Pr Organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructures, 81.16.-c Methods of nanofabrication and processing, 42.70.Qs Photonic band-gap materials.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Superhydrophobic nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (alumina) surfaces were prepared using treatment with vapor-phase hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). Nanoporous alumina substrates were first made using a two-step anodization process. Subsequently, a repeated modification procedure was employed for efficient incorporation of the terminal methyl groups of HMDS to the alumina surface. Morphology of the surfaces was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, showing hexagonally ordered circular nanopores with approximately 250 nm in diameter and 300 nm of interpore distances. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed the presence of chemically bound methyl groups on the HMDS-modified nanoporous alumina surfaces. Wetting properties of these surfaces were characterized by measurements of the water contact angle which was found to reach 153.2 ± 2°. The contact angle values on HMDS-modified nanoporous alumina surfaces were found to be significantly larger than the average water contact angle of 82.9 ± 3° on smooth thin film alumina surfaces that underwent the same HMDS modification steps. The difference between the two cases was explained by the Cassie-Baxter theory of rough surface wetting.},

abstract = {The adsorption kinetics of a cationic dye, methylene blue (MB), onto the silica nano-sheets derived from vermiculite via acid leaching was investigated in aqueous solution in a batch system with respect to contact time, initial dye concentration, pH, and temperature. Experimental results have shown that increasing initial dye concentration favors the adsorption while the acidic pH and temperature go against the adsorption. Experimental data related to the adsorption of MB on the silica nano-sheets under different conditions were applied to the pseudo-first-order equation, the pseudo-second-order equation and the intraparticle diffusion equation, and the rate constants of first-order adsorption (k(1)), the rate constants of second-order adsorption (k(2)) and intraparticle diffusion rate constants (k(int)) were calculated, respectively. The experimental data fitted very well the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The activation energy of system (E(a)) was calculated as 3.42 kJ/mol. The thermodynamics parameters of activation such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy were also evaluated and found that DeltaG*, DeltaH*, and DeltaS* are 65.95 (71.63, 77.45)kJ/mol, 0.984 (0.776, 0.568)kJ/mol, and -0.222 (-0.223, -0.224)kJ/(Kmol) at 20 (45, 70) degrees C, respectively. The desorption of the dye on the silica nano-sheets using ethanol was also investigated primarily.},

abstract = {Water and methanol transport behavior, solvents adsorption and electrochemical properties of filler-free Nafion and nanocomposites based on two smectite clays, were investigated using impedance spectroscopy, DMFC tests and NMR methods, including spin-lattice relaxation and pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) diffusion under variable temperature conditions. Synthetic (Laponite) and natural (Swy-2) smectite clays, with different structural and physical parameters, were incorporated into the Nafion for the creation of exfoliated nanocomposites. Transport mechanism of water and methanol appears to be influenced from the dimensions of the dispersed platelike silicate layers as well as from their cation exchange capacity (CEC). The details of the NMR results and the effect of the methanol solution concentration are discussed. Clays particles, and in particular Swy-2, demonstrate to be a potential physical barrier for methanol cross-over, reducing the methanol diffusion with an evident blocking effect yet nevertheless ensuring a high water mobility up to 130 °C and for several hours, proving the exceptional water retention property of these materials and their possible use in the DMFCs applications. Electrochemical behavior is investigated by cell resistance and polarization measurements. From these analyses it is derived that the addition of clay materials to recast Nafion decreases the ohmic losses at high temperatures extending in this way the operating range of a direct methanol fuel cell.},

abstract = {Nanocomposites are the emerging materials of the 21st century in view of their possessing design uniqueness without any compromises, certain unusual property combinations that are not found in conventional composites, as well as a wide spectrum of applications. Polymer-based layered compound nanocomposites have special place in view of their best property enhancement. Hence, the objective of this article is to bring new ideas to optimize the design of polymer/layered compounds/fibrous nanocomposites, starting with a brief overview of the preparation, structure, properties and applications. The proposed strategy suggests the use of synthetic and natural layered compounds, taking into account their ability to be exfoliated in the form of single layers, which can be chemically grafted with key molecules. The same procedure can also be applied to fibrous materials. These surface-grafted molecules can carry reactive groups to be bonded to the polymer matrices. Thus adhesion between the reinforcement and the polymer matrix can be achieved. This methodology, which has not been explored systematically in the specialized literature, can be used to produce polymer nanocomposites with low-cost fibrous materials having similarity to expensive carbon nanotubes exhibiting optimized dispersion, interfacial bonding, and attractive physical and other properties.},

abstract = {Silica nanotubes were synthesized using the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as the template material. First, we prepared silica coated MWCNT composites by surface oxidation of MWCNTs using KMnO(4) in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst and followed by grafting of 2-aminoethyl 3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, AEAPS. The amine groups in grafted AEAPS on MWCNTs could activate the silica shell formation by acid-base interaction. The synthesized silica was formed a uniform layer on MWCNTs with a controllable thickness and possessed sturdy 3-dimensional stability. After calcinations at 800 degrees C, the inner MWCNTs of the composite were completely decomposed and the outer silica shell layer maintained without distortion of its original shape. Finally, we could obtain the silica nanotubes having 13.0 nm of average layer thickness.},

This work focuses on investigating the effect of filler's geometry (aspect ratio and shape), intrinsic electrical conductivity, alignment and dispersion within the polymer, and polymer crystallinity, on the percolation threshold and electrical conductivity of polypropylene based nanocomposites. The conductive reinforcements used are exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets, carbon black, vapor grown carbon fibers and polyacrylonitrile carbon fibers. The composites are made using melt mixing followed by injection molding. A coating method is also employed to improve the nanofiller's dispersion within the polymer and compression molding is used to alter the nanofiller's alignment.},

@article{Kleinstreuer2011,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: Nanofluids, i.e., well-dispersed (metallic) nanoparticles at low- volume fractions in liquids, may enhance the mixture's thermal conductivity, knf, over the base-fluid values. Thus, they are potentially useful for advanced cooling of micro-systems. Focusing mainly on dilute suspensions of well-dispersed spherical nanoparticles in water or ethylene glycol, recent experimental observations, associated measurement techniques, and new theories as well as useful correlations have been reviewed.It is evident that key questions still linger concerning the best nanoparticle-and-liquid pairing and conditioning, reliable measurements of achievable knf values, and easy-to-use, physically sound computer models which fully describe the particle dynamics and heat transfer of nanofluids. At present, experimental data and measurement methods are lacking consistency. In fact, debates on whether the anomalous enhancement is real or not endure, as well as discussions on what are repeatable correlations between knf and temperature, nanoparticle size/shape, and aggregation state. Clearly, benchmark experiments are needed, using the same nanofluids subject to different measurement methods. Such outcomes would validate new, minimally intrusive techniques and verify the reproducibility of experimental results. Dynamic knf models, assuming non-interacting metallic nano-spheres, postulate an enhancement above the classical Maxwell theory and thereby provide potentially additional physical insight. Clearly, it will be necessary to consider not only one possible mechanism but combine several mechanisms and compare predictive results to new benchmark experimental data sets.},

In this work, silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) was used as the silver precursor while Cts and PEG were used as the solid support and polymeric stabilizer. The properties of Ag/Cts/PEG nanocomposites (NCs) were studied under different stirring times of reaction. The developed Ag/Cts/PEG NCs were then characterized by the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.},

abstract = {The research of new molecular materials able to replace classical solid materials in electronics has attracted growing attention over the past decade. Among these compounds photoswitchable Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are particularly interesting for the elaboration of new optical memories. However these coordination polymers are generally synthesised as insoluble powders that cannot be integrated into a real device. Hence their successful integration into real applications depends on an additional processing step. Nanostructured oxides elaborated by sol-gel chemistry combined with surfactant micelle templating can be used as nanoreactors to confine PBA precipitation and organize the functional nano-objects in the three dimensions of space. In this work we present the elaboration of different CoFe PBA/silica nanocomposites. Our synthetic procedure fully controls the synthesis of PBA in the porosity of the silica matrix from the insertion of the precursors up to the formation of the photomagnetic compound. We present results on systems from the simplest to the most elaborate: from disordered xerogels to ordered nanostructured films passing through mesoporous monoliths.},

@article{Arefinia2006,
abstract = {The rheological properties of fuel suspensions with various solid loadings up to close their maximum packing fraction and suspending media having different viscosities are investigated using the rotational viscometer at relatively low shear rates in which suspensions behave as Newtonian fluids. Aluminum (Al) and ammonium perchlorate (AP) particles are major solid components of any solid fuel system which should be distributed uniformly inside a polymeric binder based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). The experimental data generated in this investigation indicates that the relative viscosity of the suspensions is independent of viscosity of polymer binder, but in addition to solid content, geometrical aspects of the solid particles affect strongly the relative viscosity of suspensions. Maximum packing fraction of filler is found to be suitable quantitative measure of filler characteristics such as size, size distribution, shape and structure. Consequently, it is revealed that the relative viscosity of fuel suspension is a unique function of reduced volume fraction (Phi). Based on analogy of viscosity enhancement of reactive resin with cure conversion and suspension with filler content, an empirical model with two adjustable parameters originated from resin gelation model is suggested. According to this model and experimental results obtained in this investigation, a generalized model is proposed to describe the relative viscosity as a function of solid content in which the adjustable parameters are found to be general constants. The generalized model which is expressed as mu(r) = (1-Phi)(0.3 Phi-2) is found to be quite accurate to predict the experimental data. Furthermore, the applicability and accuracy of the generalized model are evaluated using the viscosity data of some suspension systems reported in the literature.},

abstract = {We investigated the high-P,T annealing and mechanical properties of nanocomposite materials with a highly nitrided bulk composition close to Ti3N4. Amorphous solids were precipitated from solution by ammonolysis of metal dialkylamide precursors followed by heating at 400–700 °C in flowing NH3 to produce reddish-brown amorphous/nanocrystalline materials. The precursors were then densified at 2 GPa and 200–700 °C to form monolithic ceramics. There was no evidence for N2 loss during the high-P,T treatment. Micro- and nanoindentation experiments indicate hardness values between 4–20 GPa for loads ranging between 0.005–3 N. Young's modulus values were measured to lie in the range 200–650 GPa. Palmqvist cracks determined from microindentation experiments indicate fracture toughness values between 2–4 MPa•m1/2 similar to Si3N4, SiC and Al2O3. Significant variations in the hardness may be associated with the distribution of amorphous/crystalline regions and the very fine grained nature

abstract = {The antimicrobial properties of silver and copper nanoparticles were investigated using Escherichia coli (four strains), Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (three strains). The average sizes of the silver and copper nanoparticles were 3 nm and 9 nm, respectively, as determined through transmission electron microscopy. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra of silver and copper nanoparticles revealed that while silver was in its pure form, an oxide layer existed on the copper nanoparticles. The bactericidal effect of silver and copper nanoparticles were compared based on diameter of inhibition zone in disk diffusion tests and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of nanoparticles dispersed in batch cultures. Bacterial sensitivity to nanoparticles was found to vary depending on the microbial species. Disk diffusion studies with E. coli and S. aureus revealed greater effectiveness of the silver nanoparticles compared to the copper nanoparticles. B. subtilis depicted the highest sensitivity to nanoparticles compared to the other strains and was more adversely affected by the copper nanoparticles. Good correlation was observed between MIC and MBC (r2=0.98) measured in liquid cultures. For copper nanoparticles a good negative correlation was observed between the inhibition zone observed in disk diffusion test and MIC/MBC determined based on liquid cultures with the various strains (r2=-0.75). Although strain-specific variation in MIC/MBC was negligible for S. aureus, some strain-specific variation was observed for E. coli.},

Self-affine fractal geometry has been observed in the experimentally obtained failure surfaces of graphite platelet reinforced nanocomposites subjected to quasi-static uniaxial tensile and low velocity punch-shear loading. Fracture energy and fracture toughness are estimated analytically from the surface fractal dimensionality. Sensitivity studies show an exponential dependency of fracture energy and fracture toughness on the fractal dimensionality. Contribution of fracture energy to the total energy absorption of these nanoparticle reinforced composites is demonstrated. For the graphite platelet reinforced nanocomposites investigated, surface fractal analysis has depicted the probable ductile or brittle fracture propagation mechanism, depending upon the rate of loading.},

In addition to covering the technical aspects of these topics, the current commercial status and understanding of health implications of these technologies are also discussed. These applications were chosen because they do not involve direct addition of nanoparticles to consumed foods, and thus are more likely to be marketed to the public in the short term.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effects of calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) nanoparticles on the mechanical and thermal properties and surface morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL)/chitosan nanocomposites. The nanocomposites of PCL/chitosan/CaCO(3) were prepared using a melt blending technique. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results indicate the average size of nanoparticles to be approximately 62 nm. Tensile measurement results show an increase in the tensile modulus with CaCO(3) nanoparticle loading. Tensile strength and elongation at break show gradual improvement with the addition of up to 1 wt{\%} of nano-sized CaCO(3). Decreasing performance of these properties is observed for loading of more than 1 wt{\%} of nano-sized CaCO(3). The thermal stability was best enhanced at 1 wt{\%} of CaCO(3) nanoparticle loading. The fractured surface morphology of the PCL/chitosan blend becomes more stretched and homogeneous in PCL/chitosan/CaCO(3) nanocomposite. TEM micrograph displays good dispersion of CaCO(3) at lower nanoparticle loading within the matrix.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Recently, important efforts have been dedicated to the realization of a fascinating class of new photonic materials or metamaterials, known as photonic quasicrystals (PQCs), in which the lack of the translational symmetry is compensated by rotational symmetries not achievable by the conventional periodic crystals. As ever, more advanced functionality is demanded and one strategy is the introduction of non-linear and/or active functionality in photonic materials. In this view, core/shell nanorods (NRs) are a promising active material for light-emitting applications. In this article a two-dimensional (2D) hybrid a 2D octagonal PQC which consists of air rods in an organic/inorganic nanocomposite is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The nanocomposite was prepared by incorporating CdSe/CdS core/shell NRs into a polymer matrix. The PQC was realized by electron beam lithography (EBL) technique. Scanning electron microscopy, far field diffraction and spectra measurements are used to characterize the experimental structure. The vertical extraction of the light, by the coupling of the modes guided by the PQC slab to the free radiation via Bragg scattering, consists of a narrow red emissions band at 690 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 21.5 nm. The original characteristics of hybrid materials based on polymers and colloidal NRs, able to combine the unique optical properties of the inorganic moiety with the processability of the host matrix, are extremely appealing in view of their technological impact on the development of new high performing optical devices such as organic light-emitting diodes, ultra-low threshold lasers, and non-linear devices.PACS: 81.07.Pr Organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructures, 81.16.-c Methods of nanofabrication and processing, 42.70.Qs Photonic band-gap materials.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The AgBr loaded TiO2 catalyst was prepared by a feasible approach with AgBr and tetraisopropyl orthotitanate and characterized by BET surface area measurement, diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectra (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis. The results of characterization reveal that AgBr loaded TiO2 has a nanostructure. Formation of the nanostructure in AgBr loaded TiO2 results in substantial shifting of the absorption edge of TiO2 to red and enhancement of visible light absorption. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that AgBr loaded TiO2 has a higher photoconductivity than prepared TiO2 due to higher separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Cyclic voltammetric studies reveal enhanced conductivity in AgBr loaded TiO2, which causes an increase in its photocatalytic activity.

abstract = {The two-solvent method was employed to prepare ZnO encapsulated in mesoporous silica (ZnO/SBA-15). The prepared ZnO/SBA-15 samples have been studied by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The ZnO/SBA-15 nanocomposite has the ordered hexagonal mesostructure of SBA-15. ZnO clusters of a high loading are distributed in the channels of SBA-15. Photoluminescence spectra show the UV emission band around 368 nm, the violet emission around 420 nm, and the blue emission around 457 nm. The UV emission is attributed to band-edge emission of ZnO. The violet emission results from the oxygen vacancies on the ZnO-SiO(2) interface traps. The blue emission is from the oxygen vacancies or interstitial zinc ions of ZnO. The UV emission and blue emission show a blue-shift phenomenon due to quantum-confinement-induced energy gap enhancement of ZnO clusters. The ZnO clusters encapsulated in SBA-15 can be used as light-emitting diodes and ultraviolet nanolasers.},

abstract = {Novel covalent porphyrin and its complexes (Co(2+), Zn(2+)) functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) have been successfully synthesized by the reaction of the carboxyl on the surface of MWNTs which was synthesized to use carbon radicals generated by the thermal decomposition of azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) with 5-p-hydroxyphenyl-10,15,20-triphenyl-porphyrin and its complexes (Co(2+), Zn(2+)). Three resulting nanohybrids were characterized by spectroscopy (FT-IR, Raman, and UV-vis), TGA, and TEM. The quality of porphyrin attached to the MWNTs was determined from thermogravimeric analysis (TGA) of the MWNTs, which showed a weight loss of about 60{\%}. The Raman and absorption spectroscopy data showed that the electronic properties of modified MWNTs were mostly retained, without damaging their one-dimensional electronic properties. From fluorescence measurements, it was observed that the porphyrin and its complexes (Co(2+), Zn(2+)) were nearly quenched by MWNTs, indicating that this covalently modified mode facilitated the effective energy or electron transfer between the excited porphyrin moiety and the extended pi-system of MWNTs.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Heat dissipation from electrical appliances is a significant issue with contemporary electrical devices. One factor in the improvement of heat dissipation is the heat transfer performance of the working fluid. In this study, we used plasma arc technology to produce a nanofluid of carbon nanoparticles dispersed in distilled water. In a one-step synthesis, carbon was simultaneously heated and vaporized in the chamber, the carbon vapor and particles were then carried to a collector, where cooling furnished the desired carbon/water nanofluid. The particle size and shape were determined using the light-scattering size analyzer, SEM, and TEM. Crystal morphology was examined by XRD. Finally, the characterization include thermal conductivity, viscosity, density and electric conductivity were evaluated by suitable instruments under different temperatures. The thermal conductivity of carbon/water nanofluid increased by about 25{\%} at 50°C compared to distilled water. The experimental results demonstrated excellent thermal conductivity and feasibility for manufacturing of carbon/water nanofluids.},

Regardless of the size of the ceramics' grains, the increase of their amount leads to an increase of resistance to rupture and modulus and a decrease in limiting deformation, whereas an increase in the average ceramic grain size worsens resistance properties. The SC, thermo-chemical, mechanical and dynamic-mechanical properties of the samples were investigated. Superconducting properties of the polymer ceramic nanocomposites are explained by intercalation of macromolecule fragments into the interstitial layer of the ceramics' grains. This phenomenon leads to a change in the morphological structure of the superconducting nanocomposites.},

The naturally derived nanotubular material of imogolite represents a distinctive class of nanofiller for industrially significant polymer. The incompatibility between the surface properties of inorganic nanofiller and organic matrix has prompted the need to surface modify the imogolite. Early problems in increasing the binding properties of surface modifier to imogolite have been overcome by using a phosphonic acid group. Different approaches have been used to gain better control over the dispersal of nanofiller and to further improve the physicochemical properties of nanocomposites. Among these, polymer grafting, in situ synthesis of imogolite in polymer matrix, and spin-assembly are some of the promising methods that will be described herein. This imogolite reinforced nanocomposite of enhanced optical and mechanical properties, and with unique biological and electronic properties, is expected to become an important category of hybrid material that shows potential for industrial applications.},

Entrapment of ZnO NPs was controlled via different conditions of SMNW fabrication such as an applied potential and mixture ratio of NPs and aniline solution. The controlled concentration of ZnO NP results in changes in the physical properties of the SMNWs, as shown in transmission electron microscopy images. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and elasticity of SMNWs show improvement over those of pure polyaniline nanowire. The new nano-multicomposite material showed synergistic effects on mechanical and electrical properties, with logarithmical change and saturation increasing ZnO NP concentration.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: During the last decade, major efforts have been made to develop adequate and commercially viable processes for disintegrating cellulose fibres into their structural components. Homogenisation of cellulose fibres has been one of the principal applied procedures. Homogenisation has produced materials which may be inhomogeneous, containing fibres, fibres fragments, fibrillar fines and nanofibrils. The material has been denominated microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). In addition, terms relating to the nano-scale have been given to the MFC material. Several modern and high-tech nano-applications have been envisaged for MFC. However, is MFC a nano-structure? It is concluded that MFC materials may be composed of (1) nanofibrils, (2) fibrillar fines, (3) fibre fragments and (4) fibres. This implies that MFC is not necessarily synonymous with nanofibrils, microfibrils or any other cellulose nano-structure. However, properly produced MFC materials contain nano-structures as a main component, i.e. nanofibrils.},

The oil-based nanofluids were prepared with the lipophilic Cu nanoparticles. The transport properties, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of the nanofluids have been measured. The viscosities and thermal conductivities of the nanofluids with the surface-modified nanoparticles have higher values than the base fluids do. The composition has more significant effects on the thermal conductivity than on the viscosity. It is valuable to prepare an appropriate oil-based nanofluid for enhancing the heat-transfer capacity of a hydrophobic system. The effects of adding Cu nanoparticles on the thermal oxidation stability of the fluids were investigated by measuring the hydroperoxide concentration in the Cu/kerosene nanofluids. The hydroperoxide concentrations are observed to be clearly lower in the Cu nanofluids than in their base fluids. Appropriate amounts of metal nanoparticles added in a hydrocarbon fuel can enhance the thermal oxidation stability.},

A human osteoblast-like (HOB) cell model was used to study the long-term interaction between the HOB cells and coatings in vitro. Results showed that the number of cells growing on all coated titanium (Ti) samples were statistically significantly higher than on uncoated Ti. In addition, HOB cells growing on all SiHA surfaces displayed enhanced cell spreading, with extensive extracellular matrix synthesis. DNA staining revealed normal phenotype nuclear morphology for HOB cells, with several dense chromosomes surrounded by a periphery of intact nuclear membrane. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining indicated that cells showed improved adhesion on the coated surfaces with increasing Si content, developing mature cytoskeletons with numerous distinct and well-defined actin stress fibres in the cell membranes. Results also demonstrated that the bone mineralisation process was greatest in the presence of the highest Si level (4.9 wt{\%}). However, at very early culturing time point, cells did not attach so readily on the surface of this coating due to rapid dissolution. Thus, this work suggests that a Si content of 2.2 wt{\%} may be the optimum loading to improve the bioactive property of HA thin films.},

In order to use HA as injectable nanoparticles that can be directed at will to various locations in the body to treat bone defects, HA was coated onto iron oxide nanoparticles in this study. Specifically, magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles were synthesized and coated with HA. The resulting nanoparticles were treated hydrothermally to control the crystalline properties of the coating. Nanoparticles were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, Ζeta potential and vibrating sample magnetometry. Nanoparticle uptake by osteoblasts was studied using TEM. Osteoblast density was measured after 1, 3 and 5days in the presence of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles alone and HA-coated Fe(3)O(4) magnetic nanoparticles. Long-term osteoblast experiments demonstrated greater alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein synthesis, collagen synthesis and calcium deposition after 7, 14 and 21days in the presence of greater concentrations (up to 200$\mu$gml(-1)) of HA-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. In summary, the results of this study showed that HA-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles should be further studied for various orthopedic applications in which such particles could be injected, their location controlled using an external magnetic source and bone growth promoted.},

The filter-cakes of HA and silicate-substituted hydroxyapatite (SiHA) compositions were processed into granules 1.0-2.0 mm in diameter and sintered at 1200 degrees C for 2 h. The sintered granules underwent full structural characterisation, prior to assessment in an ovine defect model by implantation for a period of 6 and 12 weeks. The results indicate that HA and SiHA implants were well accepted by the host tissue, with no evidence of inflammation. New bone formation was observed directly on the surfaces and in the spaces between the granular implants. Quantitative histomorphometry as determined by the percentage of bone ingrowth and bone coverage for both SiHA implant compositions was significantly greater than that for phase pure HA. These findings indicate that the in vivo bioactivity of hydroxyapatite was significantly improved by the incorporation of silicate ions into the HA structure, making SiHA ceramics attractive alternatives to conventional HA materials for use as bone graft substitute ceramics.},

The interaction energies, deduced by fitting the experimental data with a coupled oscillator model, amount to 22 meV for the plasmon/light-hole exciton and 21 meV for the plasmon/heavy-hole exciton.

abstract = {The optimal concentration at which Si induces cell functions has not been fully elucidated. In the present study the effects of Si concentration (0-6 mM) on the biological functions of MG63 cells were investigated. Cell proliferation in the presence of 2 mM Si- and 4 mM Si-containing media progressively increased with culture time, whereas that of 6mM Si treated MG63 cells was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced. The unusually high Si concentration (6 mM) induced a significant (P{\textless}0.05) increase in the sub-G1 phase of cells from the original 3.60{\%} up to 43.01{\%} after culture for 12 h. In contrast, the other lower Si concentration treated MG63 cells in the sub-G1 phase were in the range 3-5{\%} at all culture time points. 4 mM Si treated MG63 cells, but not 6 mM Si treated MG63 cells, showed remarkably enhanced collagen type I (COL I) gene expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) secretion, which were significantly (P{\textless}0.05) higher than those in the control medium. The activation of ERK was also stimulated in MG63 cells by 4 mM Si. Cells cultured in the presence of 4 mM Si were found to have calcium matrix formation on day 7 that was 15-fold greater than that in the control medium. The results obtained in this study may be useful in designing calcium silicate-based materials with optimal biological properties.},

abstract = {In order to enhance the utilization of magnetic nanoparticles in biological systems, it is important to develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions that take place between the two systems. Magnetic nanoparticles are of particular interest for applications such as transfection, biodetection, and targeted drug delivery to name a few. The goal of this research was to study the effect iron oxide nanoparticles have on cellular growth and function, as well as to improve the particles' stability and biocompatibility in aqueous and biological media. Particle synthesis consisted of producing magnetite using the Massart method. Composite iron oxide nanoparticles produced under combustion synthesis were also studied. Previous results indicated that the inorganic nanoparticles formed small aggregates in microbial growth media, thus influencing particle stability. To mitigate this problem, a stabilizing polymer known as gum arabic was tested to control particle size and prevent further agglomeration in aqueous and growth media. Results showed that gum arabic greatly improved particle stability. Growth studies measured the influence of the nanoparticles on cell proliferation using both M9 and Luria Bertani media to track growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in minimal and rich growth conditions. In addition to E. coli, prostate carcinoma cells (cell line DU145) were cultured in the presence of the treated nanoparticles to determine whether gum arabic improved the uptake of the particles in mammalian cells. Fluorescent microscopy was incorporated to detect the location of the nanoparticles in or about the cells by labeling the gum arabic with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The results illustrate the potential use of gum arabic as a surface-modifying agent to improve magnetic particle stability, as well as to promote nanoparticle uptake by mammalian cell cultures.},

abstract = {The precipitation of calcium carbonate as a binding salt for the consolidation of loose sand formations is a promising approach. The heterogeneous nucleation and growth of calcite were investigated in supersaturated solutions. The ionic activities in the solutions tested were selected so that they included both supersaturations in which crystal growth took place only following the introduction of seed particles and supersaturations in which precipitation occurred spontaneously past the lapse of induction times. In the latter case the supersaturation conditions were sufficiently low to allow the measurement of induction times preceding the onset of precipitation. The stability domain of the calcium carbonate system was established at pH 8.50, 25 degrees C, measuring the induction times in the range between 30 min and 2 h. The rates of precipitation following the destabilization of the solutions were measured from the pH and/or concentration-time profiles. The induction times were inversely proportional and rates proportional to the solution supersaturation as expected. The high-order dependence of the rates of precipitation on the solution supersaturation suggested a polynuclear growth mechanism. Fitting of the induction time-supersaturation data according to this model yielded a value of 64 mJ/m2 for the surface energy of the calcite nucleus. In the concentration domain corresponding to stable supersaturated solutions, seeded growth experiments at constant supersaturation showed a second-order dependence on the rates of crystal growth of calcite seed crystals. Inoculation of the stable supersaturated solutions with quartz seed crystals failed to induce nucleation. Raising supersaturation to reach the unstable domain showed interesting features: calcite seed crystals yielded crystal growth kinetics compatible with the polynuclear growth model, without any induction time. The presence of quartz seed crystals reduced the induction times and resulted in nucleation in the bulk solution. The kinetic data in the latter case were consistent with the polynuclear growth model and the surface energy for the newly forming embryo was calculated equal to 31.1 mJ/m2, because of the dominantly heterogeneous nature of the process.},

abstract = {Engineered magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) represent a cutting-edge tool in medicine because they can be simultaneously functionalized and guided by a magnetic field. Use of MNPs has advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), guided drug and gene delivery, magnetic hyperthermia cancer therapy, tissue engineering, cell tracking and bioseparation. Integrative therapeutic and diagnostic (i.e., theragnostic) applications have emerged with MNP use, such as MRI-guided cell replacement therapy or MRI-based imaging of cancer-specific gene delivery. However, mounting evidence suggests that certain properties of nanoparticles (e.g., enhanced reactive area, ability to cross cell and tissue barriers, resistance to biodegradation) amplify their cytotoxic potential relative to molecular or bulk counterparts. Oxidative stress, a 3-tier paradigm of nanotoxicity, manifests in activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (tier I), followed by a proinflammatory response (tier II) and DNA damage leading to cellular apoptosis and mutagenesis (tier III). Invivo administered MNPs are quickly challenged by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), resulting in not only neutralization of potential MNP toxicity but also reduced circulation time necessary for MNP efficacy. We discuss the role of MNP size, composition and surface chemistry in their intracellular uptake, biodistribution, macrophage recognition and cytotoxicity, and review current studies on MNP toxicity, caveats of nanotoxicity assessments and engineering strategies to optimize MNPs for biomedical use.},

abstract = {Fetal chondrocytes (FCs) have recently been identified as an alternative cell source for cartilage tissue engineering applications because of their partially chondrogenically differentiated phenotype and developmental plasticity. In this study, chondrocytes derived from fetal bovine cartilage were characterized and then cultured on commercially available Cytodex-1 and Biosilon microcarriers and thermosensitive poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PHEMA-PNIPAAm) beads produced by us. Growth kinetics of FCs were estimated by means of specific growth rate and metabolic activity assay. Cell detachment from thermosensitive microcarriers was induced by cold treatment at 4 °C for 20 min or enzymatic treatment was applied for the detachment of cells from Cytodex-1 and Biosilon. Although attachment efficiency and proliferation of FCs on PHEMA-PNIPAAm beads were lower than that of commercial Cytodex-1 and Biosilon microcarriers, these beads also supported growth of FCs. Detached cells from thermosensitive beads by cold induction exhibited a normal proliferative activity. Our results indicated that Cytodex-1 microcarrier was the most suitable material for the production of FCs in high capacity, however, 'thermosensitive microcarrier model' could be considered as an attractive solution to the process scale up for cartilage tissue engineering by improving surface characteristics of PHEMA-PNIPAAm beads.},

abstract = {In this review, we highlight particle based crystallization pathways leading to single crystals via mesoscopic transformation. In contrast to the classical mechanism of atom/molecule mediated growth of a single crystal, the particle mediated growth and assembly mechanisms are summarized as "non-classical crystallization", including exiting processes like oriented attachment and mesocrystal formation. Detailed investigations of non-classical crystallization mechanisms are a recent development, but evidence for these pathways is rapidly increasing in the literature. A major driving force for these investigations originates from biomineralization, because it seems that these crystallization routes are frequently applied by natural organisms. We give a non-exhaustive literature survey on these two mechanisms with a focus on recent examples and studies, which are dedicated to a mechanistic understanding. Furthermore, conditions are introduced for which these non-classical crystallization mechanisms can be expected, as they are always an alternative reaction pathway to classical crystallization.},

abstract = {Stem cell therapies offer great promise for many diseases, especially those without current effective treatments. It is believed that noninvasive imaging techniques, which offer the ability to track the status of cells after transplantation, will expedite progress in this field and help to achieve maximized therapeutic effect. Today's biomedical imaging technology allows for real-time, noninvasive monitoring of grafted stem cells including their biodistribution, migration, survival, and differentiation, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of nanoparticle-labeled cells being one of the most commonly used techniques. Among the advantages of MR cell tracking are its high spatial resolution, no exposure to ionizing radiation, and clinical applicability. In order to track cells by MRI, the cells need to be labeled with magnetic nanoparticles, for which many types exist. There are several cellular labeling techniques available, including simple incubation, use of transfection agents, magnetoelectroporation, and magnetosonoporation. In this overview article, we will review the use of different magnetic nanoparticles and discuss how these particles can be used to track the distribution of transplanted cells in different organ systems. Caveats and limitations inherent to the tracking of nanoparticle-labeled stem cells are also discussed.

abstract = {Magnetron co-sputtering has been employed to fabricate thin nanocrystalline coatings of silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (SiHA) of different Si compositions: 0.8 wt{\%}, 2.2 wt{\%}, and 4.9 wt{\%}. A human osteoblast-like (HOB) cell model was used to study the long-term interaction between the HOB cells and coatings in vitro. Results showed that the number of cells growing on all coated titanium (Ti) samples were statistically significantly higher than on uncoated Ti. In addition, HOB cells growing on all SiHA surfaces displayed enhanced cell spreading, with extensive extracellular matrix synthesis. DNA staining revealed normal phenotype nuclear morphology for HOB cells, with several dense chromosomes surrounded by a periphery of intact nuclear membrane. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining indicated that cells showed improved adhesion on the coated surfaces with increasing Si content, developing mature cytoskeletons with numerous distinct and well-defined actin stress fibres in the cell membranes. Results also demonstrated that the bone mineralisation process was greatest in the presence of the highest Si level (4.9 wt{\%}). However, at very early culturing time point, cells did not attach so readily on the surface of this coating due to rapid dissolution. Thus, this work suggests that a Si content of 2.2 wt{\%} may be the optimum loading to improve the bioactive property of HA thin films.},

abstract = {Calcium phosphate cements are used as bone substitute materials because they may be moulded to fill a void or defect in bone and are osteoconductive. Although apatite cements are stronger than brushite cements, they are potentially less resorbable in vivo. Brushite cements are three-component systems whereby phosphate ions and water react with a soluble calcium phosphate to form brushite (CaHPO4 x 2H2O). Previously reported brushite cement formulations set following the mixture of a calcium phosphate, such as beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), with an acidic component such as H3PO4 or monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM). Due to its low solubility, hydroxyapatite (HA) is yet to be reported as a reactive component in calcium phosphate cement systems. Here we report a new cement system setting to form a matrix consisting predominantly of brushite following the mixture of phosphoric acid with nanocrystalline HA. As a result of the relative ease with which ionic substitutions may be made in apatite this route may offer a novel way to control cement composition or setting characteristics. Since kinetic solubility is dependent on particle size and precipitation temperature is known to affect precipitated HA crystal size, the phase composition and mechanical properties of cements made from HA precipitated at temperatures between 4 and 60 degrees C were investigated.},

abstract = {Silicon-containing hydroxyapatites were synthesized by the controlled crystallization method. Chemical analysis, N(2) adsorption, Hg porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the hydroxyapatite and to monitor the development of a calcium phosphate layer onto the surface of the substrate immersed in a simulated body fluid, that is, in vitro bioactivity tests. The influence of the silicon content and the nature of the starting calcium and phosphorus sources on the in vitro bioactivity of the resulting materials were studied. A sample of silicocarnotite, whose structure is related to that of hydroxyapatite and contains isolated SiO(4) (4-) anions that isomorphically substitute some PO(4) (3-) anions, was prepared and used as reference material for XPS studies. An increase of the unit cell parameters with the Si content was observed, which indicated that SiO(4) (4-) units are present in lattice positions, replacing some PO(4) (3-) groups. By using XPS it was possible to assess the presence of monomeric SiO(4) (4-) units in the surface of apatite samples containing 0.8 wt {\%} of silicon, regardless the nature of the starting raw materials, either Ca(NO(3))(2)/(NH(4))(2)HPO(4)/Si(OCOCH(3))(4) or Ca(OH)(2)/H(3)PO(4)/Si(OCOCH(3))(4). However, an increase of the silicon content up to 1.6 wt {\%} leads to the polymerization of the silicate species at the surface. This technique shows silicon enrichment at the surface of the three samples. The in vitro bioactivity assays showed that the formation of an apatite-like layer onto the surface of silicon-containing substrates is strongly enhanced as compared with pure silicon-free hydroxyapatite. The samples containing monomeric silicate species showed higher in vitro bioactivity than that of silicon-rich sample containing polymeric silicate species. The use of calcium and phosphate salts as precursors lead to materials with higher bioactivity.},

abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {This dissertation reports the design of a process (patent pending) to remove iron from acid mine drainage (AMD) without the formation of metal hydroxide sludge. The system includes the oxidation of ferrous iron in a packed bed bioreactor, the precipitation of iron within a fluidized bed, the removal of manganese and heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) in a trickling filter at high ({\textgreater}9) pH, with final neutralization in a carbonate bed. The technique avoided the generation of iron oxyhydroxide sludge. In the packed bed bioreactor, maximum substrate oxidation rate (R,max) was 1500 mg L -1 h -1 at dilution rates of 2 h -1 , with oxidation efficiency at 98{\%}. The half-saturation constant (similar to a Ks ) was 6 mg L -1 . The oxidation rate was affected by dissolved oxygen below 2 mg L -1 , with a Monod-type Ko for DO of 0.33 mg L -1 . Temperature had a significant effect on oxidation rate, but pH (2.0 to 3.25) and supplemental CO2 did not affect oxidation rates. Iron hydroxide precipitation was not instantaneous when base was added at a OH/Fe ratio of less than 3. Induction time was found to be a function of pH, sulfate concentration and iron concentration, with a multiple R 2 of 0.84. Aqueous [Al (III)] and [Mn (II)] did not significantly ($\alpha$ = 0.05) affect induction time over the range of concentrations investigated. When specific loading to the fluidized bed reactor exceeded 0.20 mg Fe m -2 h -1 , dispersed iron particulates formed leading to a turbid effluent. Reactor pH determined the minimum iron concentration in the effluent, with an optimal at pH 3.5. Total iron removals of 98{\%} were achieved in the fluidized bed with effluent [Fe] below 10 mg L -1 . Further iron removal occurred within the calcium carbonate bed. Heavy metals were removed both in the fluidized bed reactor as well as in the trickling filter. Oxidation at pH {\textgreater}9 caused manganese to precipitate (96{\%} removal); removals of copper, nickel, and zinc were due primarily to sorption onto oxide surfaces. Removals averaged 97{\%} for copper, 70{\%} for nickel and 94{\%} for zinc. The treatment strategy produced an effluent relatively free of iron ({\textless} 3 mg/L), without the formation of iron sludge and may be suitable for AMD seeps, drainage from acidic tailings ponds, active mine effluent, and acidic iron-rich industrial wastewater},

abstract = {The behaviour of calcium phosphate (CaP) based biomaterials in biological environments determines how they can be used in vivo. The prime requirement for CaP materials to be bioactive and bond to living bone is the formation of a bone-like apatite layer on their surface. This phenomenon can be reproduced in vitro using simulated body fluid (SBF): a protein-free solution with ion concentrations similar to those of human blood plasma. Although proteins are unanimously considered as important actors in CaP material bioactivity and biomineralization processes, a certain confusion exists about their role as promotors or inhibitors of mineral crystal formation or both. The adsorption of proteins on the mineral surface can alter the nucleation rate and lead to antagonistic effects depending on the concentration of the adsorbed proteins. The ambiguity of this general effect is illustrated by the action of albumin on calcium phosphate crystallization on type I collagen and several other examples found in the literature.},

Our previously published results from homing pigeons have made us suggest that the iron containing sensory dendrites in the inner dermal lining of the upper beak are a candidate structure for such an avian magnetometer system. Here we show that similar structures occur in two species of migratory birds (garden warbler, Sylvia borin and European robin, Erithacus rubecula) and a non-migratory bird, the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus). In all these bird species, histological data have revealed dendrites of similar shape and size, all containing iron minerals within distinct subcellular compartments of nervous terminals of the median branch of the Nervus ophthalmicus. We also used microscopic X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses to identify the involved iron minerals to be almost completely Fe III-oxides. Magnetite (Fe II/III) may also occur in these structures, but not as a major Fe constituent. Our data suggest that this complex dendritic system in the beak is a common feature of birds, and that it may form an essential sensory basis for the evolution of at least certain types of magnetic field guided behavior.},

abstract = {There has been an intensive research effort directed at determining the cause of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury over the past decade, but few studies have reported data on the incidence of ACL and other knee ligament injury in the general population. New Zealand's no-fault injury compensation data provides a national injury resource of data on claims for knee ligament injury. The goal of this paper was to provide a descriptive epidemiology of knee ligament injury in this country. Data were obtained for knee ligament injuries between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2005. Injuries were categorised as non-surgical (NS), ACL surgeries (ACLS) and other knee ligament surgeries (OKLS). Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were computed using population estimates. Costs and number of treatment/rehabilitation visits were obtained as an indication of severity. The incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 1147.1 for NS, 36.9 for ACLS and 9.1 for OKLS. Males had a higher incidence rate than females for NS, ACLS, and OKLS. The mean (and median) number of treatment visits were NS: 6.6 (4), ACLS: 27.1 (24), and OKLS: 31.3 (24). The mean (median) treatment costs of these injuries were NS {\$}885 ({\$}129), ACLS {\$}11,157 ({\$}8574), and OKLS {\$}15,663 ({\$}8054). Analysis of injury descriptions for ACLS injuries indicated that 58{\%} involved a non-contact mechanism of injury. These data underscore the high level of short-term disability associated with knee ligament injuries, especially ACL injuries that require surgery.},

abstract = {The present in vitro study created nanometer crystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) and amorphous calcium phosphate for novel orthopedic applications. Specifically, nano-crystalline HA and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles were synthesized by a wet chemical process followed by hydrothermal treatment for 2 hours at 200 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively. Resulting particles were then pressed into compacts. For the preparation of control conventional HA particles (or those currently used in orthopedics with micron diameters), the aforementioned calcium phosphate particles were pressed into compacts and sintered at 1100 degrees C for 2 hours. All calcium phosphate-based particles were fully characterized. Results showed that although there was an initial weight gain for all the compacts studied in this experiment, higher eventual degradation rates up to 3 weeks were observed for nano-amorphous calcium phosphate compared with nano-crystalline HA which was higher than conventional HA. Peptide functionalization (with the cell adhesive peptide lysine-arginine-serine-arginine [KRSR] and the non-cell-adhesive peptide lysine-serine-arginine-arginine [KSRR]) was accomplished by means of a three-step reaction procedure: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), cross-linking with N-succinimidyl-3-maleimido propionate (SMP), and finally peptide immobilization. The peptide functionalization was fully characterized. Results demonstrated increased osteoblast (bone-forming cell) adhesion on non-functionalized and functionalized nano-crystalline HA compacts compared with nano amorphous calcium phosphate compacts; both increased osteoblast adhesion compared with conventional HA. To further exemplify the novel properties of nano crystalline HA, results also showed similar osteoblast adhesion between non-functionalized nano crystalline HA and KRSR functionalized conventional HA. Thus, results provided evidence that nanocrystalline HA should be further studied for orthopedic applications.},

Here we review present equilibrium and non-equilibrium self-assembly approaches to the synthetic construction of discrete hybrid (inorganic-organic) nano-objects and higher-level nanostructured networks. We examine a range of synthetic modalities under equilibrium conditions that give rise to integrative self-assembly (supramolecular wrapping, nanoscale incarceration and nanostructure templating) or higher-order self-assembly (programmed/directed aggregation). We contrast these strategies with processes of transformative self-assembly that use self-organizing media, reaction-diffusion systems and coupled mesophases to produce higher-level hybrid structures under non-equilibrium conditions. Key elements of the constructional codes associated with these processes are identified with regard to existing theoretical knowledge, and presented as a heuristic guideline for the rational design of hybrid nano-objects and nanomaterials.},

In detail the authors found the following: (i) A two stage growth process showing spontaneously formed primary particles with a size of about 500 A diameter that subsequently transformed to 1000 A sized particles which were stable for at least 24 h. (ii) A particular shielding topology was observed for the second CPP state, namely, that a densely packed fetuin-A monolayer covers a mineral core and thereby prevents further crystal growth. (iii) Transmission electron microscopy analysis of in vitro synthesized second state CPPs revealed striking similarities to material retrieved from a human peritonitis patient. This latter finding underscores the importance of short- and long-term stabilizations of CPPs by fetuin-A to enable clearing of mineral debris in the body.},

The objectives of this study were to develop a calcium phosphate nanoparticle encapsulation system for organic dyes and therapeutic drugs so that advanced fluoresence methods could be used to assess the efficiency of drug delivery and possible mechanisms of nanoparticle bioabsorption. Highly concentrated CPNPs encapsulating a variety of organic fluorophores were successfully synthesized. Well-dispersed CPNPs encapsulating Cy3 amidite exhibited nearly a 5-fold increase in fluorescence quantum yield when compared to the free dye in PBS. FCS diffusion data and cell staining were used to show pH-dependent dissolution of the particles and cellular uptake, respectively. Furthermore, an experimental hydrophobic cell growth inhibitor, ceramide, was successfully delivered in vitro to human vascular smooth muscle cells via encapsulation in CPNPs. These studies demonstrate that CPNPs are effective carriers of dyes and drugs for bioimaging and, potentially, for therapeutic intervention.},

Their biological nature has been severely challenged by both geologists and microbiologists, with opinions ranging from considering them crystal structures to new life forms. Although the nature of these autonomously replicating particles is still under debate, their role in several calcification-related diseases has been reported. In order to gain better insights on this calciferous agent, we performed a large-scale project, including the analysis of "nanobacteria" susceptibility to physical and chemical compounds as well as the comprehensive nucleotide, biochemical, proteomic, and antigenic analysis of these particles. Our results definitively ruled out the existence of "nanobacteria" as living organisms and pointed out the paradoxical role of fetuin (an anti-mineralization protein) in the formation of these self-propagating mineral complexes which we propose to call "nanons." The presence of fetuin within renal calculi was also evidenced, suggesting its role as a hydroxyapatite nucleating factor.},

abstract = {Fetal chondrocytes (FCs) have recently been identified as an alternative cell source for cartilage tissue engineering applications because of their partially chondrogenically differentiated phenotype and developmental plasticity. In this study, chondrocytes derived from fetal bovine cartilage were characterized and then cultured on commercially available Cytodex-1 and Biosilon microcarriers and thermosensitive poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PHEMA-PNIPAAm) beads produced by us. Growth kinetics of FCs were estimated by means of specific growth rate and metabolic activity assay. Cell detachment from thermosensitive microcarriers was induced by cold treatment at 4 °C for 20 min or enzymatic treatment was applied for the detachment of cells from Cytodex-1 and Biosilon. Although attachment efficiency and proliferation of FCs on PHEMA-PNIPAAm beads were lower than that of commercial Cytodex-1 and Biosilon microcarriers, these beads also supported growth of FCs. Detached cells from thermosensitive beads by cold induction exhibited a normal proliferative activity. Our results indicated that Cytodex-1 microcarrier was the most suitable material for the production of FCs in high capacity, however, 'thermosensitive microcarrier model' could be considered as an attractive solution to the process scale up for cartilage tissue engineering by improving surface characteristics of PHEMA-PNIPAAm beads.},

abstract = {Temporally and spatially controlled delivery of growth factors in polymeric scaffolds is crucial for engineering composite tissue structures, such as osteochondral constructs. In the present study, microsphere-mediated growth factor delivery in polymer scaffolds and its impact on osteochondral differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was evaluated. Two growth factors, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I), were incorporated as a single concentration gradient or reverse gradient combining two factors in the scaffolds. To assess the gradient making system and the delivery efficiency of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and silk fibroin microspheres, initially an alginate gel was fabricated into a cylinder shape with microspheres incorporated as gradients. Compared to PLGA microspheres, silk microspheres were more efficient in delivering rhBMP-2, probably due to sustained release of the growth factor, while less efficient in delivering rhIGF-I, likely due to loading efficiency. The growth factor gradients formed were shallow, inducing non-gradient trends in hMSC osteochondral differentiation. Aqueous-derived silk porous scaffolds were used to incorporate silk microspheres using the same gradient process. Both growth factors formed deep and linear concentration gradients in the scaffold, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After seeding with hMSCs and culturing for 5 weeks in a medium containing osteogenic and chondrogenic components, hMSCs exhibited osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation along the concentration gradients of rhBMP-2 in the single gradient of rhBMP-2 and reverse gradient of rhBMP-2/rhIGF-I, but not the rhIGF-I gradient system, confirming that silk microspheres were more efficient in delivering rhBMP-2 than rhIGF-I for hMSCs osteochondrogenesis. This novel silk microsphere/scaffold system offers a new option for the delivery of multiple growth factors with spatial control in a 3D culture environment for both understanding natural tissue growth process and in vitro engineering complex tissue constructs.},

VEGF has also been implicated in pathological angiogenesis associated with tumors, intraocular neovascular disorders and other conditions. The biological effects of VEGF are mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, which differ considerably in signaling properties. Non-signaling co-receptors also modulate VEGF RTK signaling. Currently, several VEGF inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing in several malignancies. VEGF inhibition is also being tested as a strategy for the prevention of angiogenesis, vascular leakage and visual loss in age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {A low efficiency has long been the most critical problem of conventional gene-transferring systems using calcium phosphates, and this was successfully improved on by using a laminin-DNA-apatite composite (LD-Ap) layer. The gene-transferring efficiency of the LD-Ap surface was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a DNA-calcium phosphate composite surface. This is because laminin enhances cell adhesion and spreading, and this provides regions of high DNA concentration between a cell and the LD-Ap surface. The efficiency of gene transfer of the LD-Ap surface was equivalent to, or even higher than that mediated using a commercial lipid-based transfection reagent applied using the manufacturer's recommended optimum conditions. In addition, the gene-transferring efficiency of our system could be controlled by changing the laminin and DNA content in the LD-Ap layer. Moreover, our system is composed of highly safe reagents: apatite, DNA and laminin, all of which are present in the human body. Hence, the LD-Ap surface, which enhances cell attachment on its surface, and mediates a safe, highly efficient and controllable gene transfer, is highly applicable to tissue engineering and gene therapy applications.},

The chemical nature of this iron pool is unknown but almost certainly it is a multicomponent pool including a considerable proportion of protein-bound iron. Methods are required to separate and quantify these different components. The biological properties of the individual isoforms need to be established; it is possible that some forms are relatively nontoxic, while others are highly toxic. This paper reviews what is known about the nature of nontransferrin-bound iron and describes the methods currently available to quantify this important serum component.},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {Serum-derived granulations and purported nanobacteria (NB) are pleomorphic apatite structures shown to resemble calcium granules widely distributed in nature. They appear to be assembled through a dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism involving proteinaceous factors, as determined by protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and heat inactivation studies. When inoculated into cell culture medium, the purified proteins fetuin-A and albumin fail to induce mineralization, but they will readily combine with exogenously added calcium and phosphate, even in submillimolar amounts, to form complexes that will undergo morphological transitions from nanoparticles to spindles, films, and aggregates. As a mineralization inhibitor, fetuin-A is much more potent than albumin, and it will only seed particles at higher mineral-to-protein concentrations. Both proteins display a bell-shaped, dose-dependent relationship, indicative of the same dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism seen with whole serum. As ascertained by both seeding experiments and gel electrophoresis, fetuin-A is not only more dominant but it appears to compete avidly for nanoparticle binding at the expense of albumin. The nanoparticles formed in the presence of fetuin-A are smaller than their albumin counterparts, and they have a greater tendency to display a multi-layered ring morphology. In comparison, the particles seeded by albumin appear mostly incomplete, with single walls. Chemically, spectroscopically, and morphologically, the protein-mineral particles resemble closely serum granules and NB. These particles are thus seen to undergo an amorphous to crystalline transformation, the kinetics and completeness of which depend on the protein-to-mineral ratios, with low ratios favoring faster conversion to crystals. Our results point to a dual inhibitory-seeding, de-repression model for the assembly of particles in supersaturated solutions like serum. The presence of proteins and other inhibitory factors tend to block apatite nuclei formation or to stabilize the nascent nuclei as amorphous or semi-crystalline spherical nanoparticles, until the same inhibitory influences are overwhelmed or de-repressed, whereby the apatite nuclei grow in size to coalesce into crystalline spindles and films-a mechanism that may explain not only the formation of calcium granules in nature but also normal or ectopic calcification in the body.},

abstract = {The serum protein fetuin-A is a potent systemic inhibitor of soft tissue calcification. Fetuin-A is highly effective in the formation and stabilization of protein-mineral colloids, referred to as calciprotein particles (CPPs). These particles ripen in vitro in a two-step process, indicated by a morphological conversion from spheres to larger prolate ellipsoids. Using a combined light scattering and electron microscopic imaging approach we determined that the second-stage particles resulted from a highly anisotropic outgrowth of the first-stage particles. Electron microscopy of ascites fluid from a patient with calcifying peritonitis revealed particles reminiscent of secondary CPPs. Thus, CPPs form in the body and undergo the two-step ripening at least in pathological conditions. Unlike in vitro generated CPPs, ascites-derived CPPs contained little fetuin-A but large amounts of albumin. This prompted us to study the role of fetuin-A combined with other serum proteins in CPP formation. Fetuin-A was indispensable for primary CPP formation. Albumin and acidic proteins in general greatly enhanced the fetuin-A triggered formation of secondary CPPs and, thus, substituted substantial amounts of fetuin-A without loss of inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation. Thus, direct mineral deposition from solute in the body is unlikely even at low fetuin-A serum levels as long as sufficient bulk acidic protein is available. Collectively fetuin-A and other acidic bulk plasma proteins may be considered as mineral chaperones mediating the stabilization, safe transport, and clearance in the body of calcium and phosphate as colloidal complexes, thus, preventing ectopic calcification.},

abstract = {There has been an intensive research effort directed at determining the cause of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury over the past decade, but few studies have reported data on the incidence of ACL and other knee ligament injury in the general population. New Zealand's no-fault injury compensation data provides a national injury resource of data on claims for knee ligament injury. The goal of this paper was to provide a descriptive epidemiology of knee ligament injury in this country. Data were obtained for knee ligament injuries between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2005. Injuries were categorised as non-surgical (NS), ACL surgeries (ACLS) and other knee ligament surgeries (OKLS). Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were computed using population estimates. Costs and number of treatment/rehabilitation visits were obtained as an indication of severity. The incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 1147.1 for NS, 36.9 for ACLS and 9.1 for OKLS. Males had a higher incidence rate than females for NS, ACLS, and OKLS. The mean (and median) number of treatment visits were NS: 6.6 (4), ACLS: 27.1 (24), and OKLS: 31.3 (24). The mean (median) treatment costs of these injuries were NS {\$}885 ({\$}129), ACLS {\$}11,157 ({\$}8574), and OKLS {\$}15,663 ({\$}8054). Analysis of injury descriptions for ACLS injuries indicated that 58{\%} involved a non-contact mechanism of injury. These data underscore the high level of short-term disability associated with knee ligament injuries, especially ACL injuries that require surgery.},

Further, Fe(3)O(4) can be oxidized to Fe(2)O(3), as evidenced by XRD, NEXAFS spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. The hydrophobic nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrophilic ones by adding bipolar surfactants, and aqueous nanoparticle dispersion is readily made.

abstract = {Magnetic bacteria synthesize magnetite crystals with species-dependent morphologies. The molecular mechanisms that control nano-sized magnetite crystal formation and the generation of diverse morphologies are not well understood. From the analysis of magnetite crystal-associated proteins, several low molecular mass proteins tightly bound to bacterial magnetite were obtained from Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1. These proteins showed common features in their amino acid sequences, which contain hydrophobic N-terminal and hydrophilic C-terminal regions. The C-terminal regions in Mms5, Mms6, Mms7, and Mms13 contain dense carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that bind iron ions. Nano-sized magnetic particles similar to those in magnetic bacteria were prepared by chemical synthesis of magnetite in the presence of the acidic protein Mms6. These proteins may be directly involved in biological magnetite crystal formation in magnetic bacteria.},

abstract = {Mms6 is a small acidic protein that is tightly associated with bacterial magnetite in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. This protein has previously shown iron binding activity, allowing it to generate uniform magnetic crystals by co-precipitation of ferrous and ferric ions. Here, magnetite crystals were formed by the partial oxidation of ferrous hydroxide in the presence and absence of Mms6. The crystals synthesised were systematically characterised according to their sizes and morphologies using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Mms6-mediated synthesis of magnetite by this methods produced crystals of a uniform size and narrow size distribution with a cubo-octahedral morphology, similar to bacterial magnetite observed in M. magneticum AMB-1. The crystals formed in the absence of Mms6 were octahedral, larger with an increased size distribution. Protein quantification analysis of Mms6 in the synthesised particles indicated tight association of this protein onto the crystal. Furthermore, high affinities to iron ions and a highly charged electrostatic quality suggest that the protein acts as a template for the nucleus formation and/or acts as a growth regulator by recognising crystal faces. The method introduced in this study presents an alternative route for controlling the size and shape of magnetite crystals without the use of organic solvent and high temperatures.},

abstract = {Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have analyzed magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals acid-extracted from carbonate globules in Martian meteorite ALH84001. We studied 594 magnetites from ALH84001 and grouped them into three populations on the basis of morphology: 389 were irregularly shaped, 164 were elongated prisms, and 41 were whisker-like. As a possible terrestrial analog for the ALH84001 elongated prisms, we compared these magnetites with those produced by the terrestrial magnetotactic bacteria strain MV-1. By TEM again, we examined 206 magnetites recovered from strain MV-1 cells. Natural (Darwinian) selection in terrestrial magnetotactic bacteria appears to have resulted in the formation of intracellular magnetite crystals having the physical and chemical properties that optimize their magnetic moment. In this study, we describe six properties of magnetite produced by biologically controlled mechanisms (e.g., magnetotactic bacteria), properties that, collectively, are not observed in any known population of inorganic magnetites. These criteria can be used to distinguish one of the modes of origin for magnetites from samples with complex or unknown histories. Of the ALH84001 magnetites that we have examined, the elongated prismatic magnetite particles (similar to 27{\%} of the total) are indistinguishable from the MV-1 magnetites in five of these six characteristics observed for biogenically controlled mineralization of magnetite crystals.},

This explosion of interest is primarily related to the ability to control the modification of interfaces with something approaching molecular level control and to the ability to characterise the molecular constructs by which the surface is modified. Over this time the level of sophistication of molecular constructs, and the level of knowledge related to how to fabricate molecular constructs on surfaces have advanced enormously. This critical review aims to guide researchers interested in modifying surfaces with a high degree of control to the use of organic layers. Highlighted are some of the issues to consider when working with SAMs, as well as some of the lessons learnt (169 references).},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {Serum-derived granulations and purported nanobacteria (NB) are pleomorphic apatite structures shown to resemble calcium granules widely distributed in nature. They appear to be assembled through a dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism involving proteinaceous factors, as determined by protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and heat inactivation studies. When inoculated into cell culture medium, the purified proteins fetuin-A and albumin fail to induce mineralization, but they will readily combine with exogenously added calcium and phosphate, even in submillimolar amounts, to form complexes that will undergo morphological transitions from nanoparticles to spindles, films, and aggregates. As a mineralization inhibitor, fetuin-A is much more potent than albumin, and it will only seed particles at higher mineral-to-protein concentrations. Both proteins display a bell-shaped, dose-dependent relationship, indicative of the same dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism seen with whole serum. As ascertained by both seeding experiments and gel electrophoresis, fetuin-A is not only more dominant but it appears to compete avidly for nanoparticle binding at the expense of albumin. The nanoparticles formed in the presence of fetuin-A are smaller than their albumin counterparts, and they have a greater tendency to display a multi-layered ring morphology. In comparison, the particles seeded by albumin appear mostly incomplete, with single walls. Chemically, spectroscopically, and morphologically, the protein-mineral particles resemble closely serum granules and NB. These particles are thus seen to undergo an amorphous to crystalline transformation, the kinetics and completeness of which depend on the protein-to-mineral ratios, with low ratios favoring faster conversion to crystals. Our results point to a dual inhibitory-seeding, de-repression model for the assembly of particles in supersaturated solutions like serum. The presence of proteins and other inhibitory factors tend to block apatite nuclei formation or to stabilize the nascent nuclei as amorphous or semi-crystalline spherical nanoparticles, until the same inhibitory influences are overwhelmed or de-repressed, whereby the apatite nuclei grow in size to coalesce into crystalline spindles and films-a mechanism that may explain not only the formation of calcium granules in nature but also normal or ectopic calcification in the body.},

abstract = {The precipitation of calcium carbonate as a binding salt for the consolidation of loose sand formations is a promising approach. The heterogeneous nucleation and growth of calcite were investigated in supersaturated solutions. The ionic activities in the solutions tested were selected so that they included both supersaturations in which crystal growth took place only following the introduction of seed particles and supersaturations in which precipitation occurred spontaneously past the lapse of induction times. In the latter case the supersaturation conditions were sufficiently low to allow the measurement of induction times preceding the onset of precipitation. The stability domain of the calcium carbonate system was established at pH 8.50, 25 degrees C, measuring the induction times in the range between 30 min and 2 h. The rates of precipitation following the destabilization of the solutions were measured from the pH and/or concentration-time profiles. The induction times were inversely proportional and rates proportional to the solution supersaturation as expected. The high-order dependence of the rates of precipitation on the solution supersaturation suggested a polynuclear growth mechanism. Fitting of the induction time-supersaturation data according to this model yielded a value of 64 mJ/m2 for the surface energy of the calcite nucleus. In the concentration domain corresponding to stable supersaturated solutions, seeded growth experiments at constant supersaturation showed a second-order dependence on the rates of crystal growth of calcite seed crystals. Inoculation of the stable supersaturated solutions with quartz seed crystals failed to induce nucleation. Raising supersaturation to reach the unstable domain showed interesting features: calcite seed crystals yielded crystal growth kinetics compatible with the polynuclear growth model, without any induction time. The presence of quartz seed crystals reduced the induction times and resulted in nucleation in the bulk solution. The kinetic data in the latter case were consistent with the polynuclear growth model and the surface energy for the newly forming embryo was calculated equal to 31.1 mJ/m2, because of the dominantly heterogeneous nature of the process.},

abstract = {In our earlier study, we showed that the surface hydroxyl groups of hydroxyapatite have the ability to react with organic isocyanate groups. In this study, the feasibility of grafting poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA), and Poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [poly(HEMA)] by using the reaction of isocyanate groups with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of HA was investigated. Double bonds were introduced to the surface of HA via the coupling reaction of isocyanateoethyl methacrylate (ICEM) with HA, or through hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and HA, followed by radical polymerization in MMA, BMA, or HEMA. Infrared spectra indicated the existence of polymers on the surfaces of HA. Thermogravimetric analysis also confirmed the presence of grafted polymers on the surface of HA powder particles (20-26 wt{\%}). The polymers gave typical PMMA, PBMA, or poly(HEMA) infrared spectra, with the exception of amide bands, a result of the coupling reaction of ICEM or HMDI with hydroxy groups of HA or HEMA. Therefore it is concluded that the polymers were chemically bonded to the surface of HA through the isocyanate groups of ICEM or HMDI.},

For 0 {\textless} or = x {\textless} or = 0.5, the sintering rate and grain growth decreased slightly with the amount of silicate. For larger amounts, the sintering behaviour differed with the formation of secondary phases before total densification. Sintering parameters (temperature and time) were adjusted to each composition to produce dense materials having similar microstructure without formation of these secondary phases. Dense ceramics made of pure hydroxyapatite and Si(x)HA containing various amounts of silicate (up to x = 0.6) were biologically tested in vitro with human osteoblast-like cells. The proliferation of cells on the surface of the ceramics increased up to 5 days of culture, indicating that the materials were biocompatible. However, the silicon content did not influence the cell proliferation.},

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HA) powder, porous HA, plasma-sprayed HA, apatite cements, and sintered HA have all been investigated as delivery systems for compounds such as human growth hormone and vancomycin. However, many previous studies showed that the period of release was limited to 2–3 weeks. The concept of using a nanoporous matrix as a means of immobilizing proteins is well known but has largely been confined to silica-based systems. Carbonate hydroxyapatite (CHA) is more soluble in vivo than HA, and when formed as an aqueous precipi- tate, it is often formed as nanocrystals. This study investi- gated the release profiles of ovine albumin (OVA) from CHA gel stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and double distilled water (DDW) for times of up to 1 year. It was found that 7.9{\%} OVA could be loaded onto apatitic gels by means of a purely aqueous process. This process pro- vided a simple low-temperature method of protein adsorp- tion on a high surface area apatitic matrix at physiological pH. The rate of short-term release of OVA was lower from CHAgels than from microcrystallineHApowder. However, the period of release from the CHA gel was short term and may have been associated with recrystallization of the gel. OVA loaded into CHA gel was found to remain undegraded in vitro at 37°C for periods of up to 1 year. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Bioceramic specimens have been prepared by incorporating a small amount of silicon (0.4 wt {\%}) into the structure of hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA] via an aqueous precipitation reaction to produce a silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (Si-HA). The results of chemical analysis confirmed the proposed substitution of the silicon (or silicate) ion for the phosphorus (or phosphate) ion in hydroxyapatite. The Si-HA was produced by first preparing a silicon-substituted apatite (Si-Ap) by a precipitation process. A single-phase Si-HA was obtained by heating/calcining the as-prepared Si-Ap to temperatures above 700 degrees C; no secondary phases, such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP), tetracalcium phosphate (TeCP), or calcium oxide (CaO), were observed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Although the X-ray diffraction patterns of Si-HA and stoichiometric HA appeared to be identical, refinement of the diffraction data revealed some small structural differences between the two materials. The silicon substitution in the HA lattice resulted in a small decrease in the a axis and an increase in the c axis of the unit cell. This substitution also caused a decrease in the number of hydroxyl (OH) groups in the unit cell, which was expected from the proposed substitution mechanism. The incorporation of silicon in the HA lattice resulted in an increase in the distortion of the PO4 tetrahedra, indicated by an increase in the distortion index. Analysis of the Si-HA by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that although the amount of silicon incorporated into the HA lattice was small, silicon substitution appeared to affect the FTIR spectra of HA, in particular the P-O vibrational bands. The results demonstrate that phase-pure silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite may be prepared using a simple precipitation technique.},

abstract = {Mms6 is a dominant protein that tightly associates with the surface of bacterial magnetites in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. The protein has previously been shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystals of cubo-octahedral morphology consisting of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal faces with a narrow size distribution during chemical magnetite synthesis. In order to understand the role of this protein in chemical magnetite synthesis, magnetite formation was investigated using synthetic peptides mimicking the Mms6 protein. Particles that were synthesized in the presence of short peptides harbouring the C-terminal acidic region of Mms6 exhibited a spherical morphology with circularities of 0.70-0.90 similar to those of bacterial magnetites and particles formed in the presence of the Mms6 protein. In contrast, a rectangular morphology with circularities of 0.60-0.85 were obtained when other peptides were used for synthesis. The results indicated that the C-terminal region of the Mms6 protein has significant control over the morphology of magnetite crystals in the chemical synthetic method. This method can, therefore, be useful as an alternative method of controlling the size and morphology of magnetite crystals under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Since surface properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) play an important role in its performance, surface modification of HA has gained much attention from researchers. Silane coupling agents have been the focus of the research. In this study, an effective surface modification method was developed using hexamethylene diisocyanate as a coupling agent. Polyethylene glycol (Mw = 1500) was successfully coupled to the surface of nano-size apatite particles (nano-apatite). Various methods were used to characterize the surface-modified nano-apatite. Infra-red spectra confirmed the existence of a layer of polymer with both urethane and ether linkage on the surface of nano-apatite. The amount of grafted polymer as determined by total organic carbon analysis (TOC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was about 20{\%} in weight. Solid 1H MAS NMR spectra indicated that the amount of hydroxyl groups of nano-apatite was decreased by 7.7{\%} after surface grafting reaction. It is concluded that the surface hydroxyl groups of nano-apatite have the reactivity towards isocyanate groups.},

abstract = {Tailoring the structure of nanocrystal superlattices is an important step toward controlled design of novel nanostructured materials and devices. We demonstrate how the long-range order and macroscopic dimensions of magnetic nanoparticle arrays can be controlled by the use of a modulated magnetic field. Inducing a dipolar attraction during the initial stage of the drying-mediated self-assembly process was sufficient to assemble the superparamagnetic oleate-capped maghemite nanocubes into large and defect-free superstructures with both translational and orientational order. The characteristic dimensions of the superlattice are controlled by the particle concentration as well as the duration of the applied magnetic field. The superparamagnetic maghemite nanocubes assemble into large and highly oriented thin arrays by applying the magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate surface only during the initial phase of drying-mediated self-assembly. Micrometer-sized and thick three-dimensional mesocrystals are obtained when the drying dispersion is subjected to an external magnetic field of moderate strength for the entire duration of the assembly process. The discovery of how translational and orientation order of nanocrystal superlattices can be induced by a temporal modulation of an anisotropic interparticle force offers new insight on the importance of the initial nucleation stage in the self-assembly process and suggests new routes for controlled self-assembly of dipolar nanocrystals.},

abstract = {Positively charged Hap nano-crystals were prepared by using beta-alanine and clarified the adsorption affinity of these surface amide functionalized Hap nano-crystals to proteins. Colloidal surface amide functionalized Hap nano-crystals were prepared by wet method in the presence of various amounts of beta-alanine by changing molar ratio of beta-alanine/Ca (beta/Ca ratio) in the solution. The rod-like nano-crystals were lengthened with addition of beta-alanine though their width did not vary; carboxyl groups of beta-alanine are strongly coordinated to Ca2+ ions exposed on ac and/or bc faces to inhibit particle growth to a- and/or b-axis directions and enhance the particle growth along to the c-axis. No difference can be recognized on the crystal structure among the synthesized Hap nano-crystals by XRD measurements. However, the large difference was recognized by TG-DTA and FTIR measurements. Those measurements revealed that beta-alanine is incorporated on the Hap nano-crystal surface up to the beta/Ca ratio of 1.0, though they are absent in the nano-crystals synthesized at beta/Ca ratio {\textgreater} or = 2.0. The zeta potential (zp) of beta-alanine-Hap nano-crystals prepared at beta/Ca = 0.4 and 1.0 of those incorporating beta-alanine exhibited positive charge at pH {\textless} or = 5.9. The saturated amounts of adsorbed BSA for the positively charged beta-alanine-Hap nano-crystals were increased 2.3-2.4-fold by their electrostatic attraction force between positively charged beta-alanine-Hap nano-crystals and negatively charged BSA molecules. We were able to control the adsorption affinity of Hap nano-crystal by changing their surface charge.},

abstract = {Gelatin is a commonly used natural polymer which is derived from collagen. The isoelectric point of gelatin can be modified during the fabrication process to yield either a negatively charged acidic gelatin, or a positively charged basic gelatin at physiological pH. This theoretically allows electrostatic interactions to take place between a charged biomolecule and gelatin of the opposite charge, forming polyion complexes. Various forms of gelatin carrier matrices can be fabricated for controlled-release studies, and characterization studies have been performed which show that gelatin carriers are able to sorb charged biomolecules such as proteins and plasmid DNA through polyion complexation. The crosslinking density of gelatin hydrogels has been shown to affect their degradation rate in vivo, and the rate of biomolecule release from gelatin carriers has been shown to have a similar profile, suggesting that complexed gelatin/biomolecule fragments are released by enzymatic degradation of the carrier in vivo. This review will emphasize how biomolecules released from gelatin controlled-release systems are able to retain their biological activity, allowing for their use in tissue engineering, therapeutic angiogenesis, gene therapy, and drug delivery applications.},

abstract = {Magnetosomes are magnetite nanoparticles formed by biomineralization within magnetotactic bacteria. Although there have been numerous genetic and proteomic studies of the magnetosome-formation process, there have been only limited and inconclusive studies of mineral-phase evolution during the formation process, and no real-time studies of such processes have yet been performed. Thus, suggested formation mechanisms still need substantiating with data. Here we report the examination of the magnetosome material throughout the formation process in a real-time in vivo study of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, strain MSR-1. Transmission EM and x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies reveal that full-sized magnetosomes are seen 15 min after formation is initiated. These immature magnetosomes contain a surface layer of the nonmagnetic iron oxide-phase hematite. Mature magnetite is found after another 15 min, concurrent with a dramatic increase in magnetization. This rapid formation result is contrary to previously reported studies and discounts the previously proposed slow, multistep formation mechanisms. Thus, we conclude that the biomineralization of magnetite occurs rapidly in magnetotactic bacteria on a similar time scale to high-temperature chemical precipitation reactions, and we suggest that this finding is caused by a biological catalysis of the process.},

Atomic step edges on the crystal surface were altered in shape and speed of growth by the proteins. Proteins attached nonuniformly to the surface, indicating different interactions with crystallographically different step edges. The observed changes were consistent with the habit modification induced by this family of proteins, as previously observed by optical microscopy. To facilitate further studies in this area, AFM techniques and certain AFM imaging artifacts are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Cross-linking of gelatin A and B with N,N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was optimised by varying the NHS/EDC molar ratio at constant EDC concentration. Native and cross-linked gelatin gels were characterised using the degree of swelling, the number of free amine groups, the phase transition temperature, and titration of the carboxylic acid residues. The cross-linking reaction was most efficient at a NHS to EDC molar ratio of 0.2. At higher NHS/EDC molar ratios, the reaction of EDC with NHS becomes more pronounced, thereby reducing the effective amount of EDC for cross-linking. Swelling measurements of cross-linked gelatin gels gave deviating results when no NHS was used, which was explained by heterogeneous localisation of cross-links in the gelatin gel. The incorporation of undesired compounds into the gelatin gels during the cross-linking reaction was not observed. At optimal NHS to EDC molar ratio, gelatin A and B were cross-linked using increasing EDC/COOHgelatin molar ratios. A range of samples varying from very low cross-link density to very high cross-link density (at high EDC/COOHgelatin) was obtained. Stability of the gels is enhanced with increasing cross-link density, but a minimal cross-link density is required to obtain gelatin gels which are stable at 40 degrees C.},

Nucleic acids alone cannot penetrate the cell membrane, therefore special carriers like cationic polymers or inorganic nanoparticles are required. Single-shell and multi-shell calcium phosphate nanoparticles were prepared and functionalized with DNA and siRNA. Thereby, the expression of enhanced green fluorescing protein (EGFP) can be induced (by using pcDNA3-EGFP) or silenced (by using siRNA). The single-shell nanoparticles were prepared by rapid mixing of aqueous solutions of calcium nitrate and diammonium hydrogen phosphate. The multi-shell nanoparticles were produced by adding further layers of calcium phosphate and DNA to protect DNA from the intracellular degradation by endonucleases. The size of the nanoparticles according to dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy was up to 100 nm with a zeta potential around -30 mV. The transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles was tested in vitro in cell culture.},

abstract = {Because of its well-defined surface configuration and creative chemical structure, an alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on gold is a model surface for a blood compatibility investigation. In this study two laboratory-synthesized long-chain alkanethiols, HS(CH(2))(10)PO(3)-(C(2)H(5))(2) and HS(CH(2))(10)PO(3)H(2), were employed for the direct preparation of SAMs with nonionic and ionic functional groups. Various instrumental analyses confirmed the high purity of the phosphonate ester and phosphonic acid terminated alkanethiols. The surface characterization results showed the -PO(3)H(2) terminated SAM was more hydrophilic than the -PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) one. Higher hysteresis values for the -PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) and -PO(3)H(2) terminated SAMs were noted, which were possibly due to the steric hindrance of the bulky terminal groups. In addition, the O(2) plasma + EtOH-rinse pretreated Au sample was hydrophilic because of the residual gold oxide on the surface. This finding was supported by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) as well. The ESCA analysis also indicated bulky and polar terminal groups [-PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) and -PO(3)H(2)] were situated in the outermost layer of its monolayer. The platelet reactivity on the SAM with the nonionic group -PO(3)(C(2)H(5))(2) was less than those of the ionic terminated SAMs -COOH and -PO(3)H(2). The O(2) plasma + EtOH-rinse pretreated gold substrate exhibited the least platelet-activating surface among the different pretreated Au substrates studied.},

abstract = {Adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on nanosized magnetic particles (Fe(3)O(4)) was carried out in the presence of carbodiimide. The equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were studied. Nanosized magnetic particles (Fe(3)O(4)) were prepared by the chemical precipitation method using Fe2+, Fe3+ salts, and ammonium hydroxide under a nitrogen atmosphere. Characterizations of magnetic particles were carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to confirm the attachment of BSA on magnetic particles. Effects of pH and salt concentrations were investigated on the adsorption process. The experimental results show that the adsorption of BSA on magnetic particles was affected greatly by the pH, while the effect of salt concentrations was insignificant at a low concentration range. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption of BSA on magnetic particles occurred at the isoelectric point of BSA. Adsorption kinetics was analyzed by a linear driving force mass-transfer model. BSA was desorbed from magnetic particles under alkaline conditions, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and FTIR results.},

Time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) and stopped-flow analysis were used to monitor the growth of protein mineral particles nucleating from supersaturated salt solutions. It was found that fetuin-A did not influence the formation of mineral nuclei. However, fetuin-A did prevent the aggregation of nuclei and thus mineral precipitation. Hence, fetuin-A shielded spontaneously formed mineral nuclei, leading to stable calciprotein particles in the first stage of mineralization. Fetuin-A is therefore critically required during the earliest stages of the formation of protein-mineral complexes in order to prevent uncontrolled mineralization.},

abstract = {Magnetic compass orientation of migratory birds is known to be light dependent, and radical-pair processes have been identified as the underlying mechanism. Here we report for the first time results of tests with European robins, Erithacus rubecula, in total darkness and, as a control, under 565 nm green light. Under green light, the robins oriented in their normal migratory direction, with southerly headings in autumn and northerly headings in spring. By contrast, in darkness they significantly preferred westerly directions in spring as well as autumn. This failure to show the normal seasonal change characterizes the orientation in total darkness as a "fixed direction" response. Tests in magnetic fields with the vertical or the horizontal component inverted showed that the preferred direction depended on the magnetic field but did not involve the avian inclination compass. A high-frequency field of 1.315 MHz did not affect the behavior, whereas local anesthesia of the upper beak resulted in disorientation. The behavior in darkness is thus fundamentally different from normal compass orientation and relies on another source of magnetic information: It does not involve the radical-pair mechanism but rather originates in the iron-containing receptors in the upper beak.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the incorporation of silicon on the surface charge of hydroxyapatite (HA) and to assess surface structural changes of HA and Si-HA induced by dissolution in both static and dynamic systems. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that SiO(4)(4-) groups were substituted for PO(4)(3-) groups in the silicon-hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) lattice according to a previously proposed substitution mechanism without the formation of other crystalline phases, such as tricalcium phosphate or calcium oxide. The substituted silicon induced a decrease in the net surface charge and the isoelectric point of HA as determined by zeta potential (ZP) measurements. At physiological pH=7.4 the surface charge of Si-HA was significantly lowered compared to unmodified HA, i.e. -50+/-5 to -71+/-5 eV, caused by the presence of silicate groups in the HA lattice, which may account for a faster in vitro apatite formation using SBF testing. XPS results indicated that silicon seems to be preferentially leached out from Si-HA surface compared to other ionic species after dissolution studies in tris-buffer using a dynamic system.},

abstract = {A promising strategy to promote angiogenesis within an engineered tissue is the local and sustained delivery of an angiogenic factor by the substitute itself. Recently, we reported on functionalization of Biocement D (BioD) and several modifications of this calcium phosphate bone cement with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Maintenance of biological activity of VEGF after release from the cement was improved by modification of BioD with mineralized collagen type I (BioD/coll). However, BioD/coll composites showed a higher initial burst of VEGF release than do the unmodified BioD. In the present study, VEGF release from BioD/coll composites modified with different amounts of heparin was investigated. We found a distinct reduction of the initial burst of release by adding heparin in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the heparin modification had a positive impact on the biological activity of released VEGF. An advancement of biological properties of BioD/coll by addition of heparin was further shown by improved adhesion of endothelial cells on the cement surface. Characterization of material properties of the heparin-modified BioD/coll composites revealed a finer microstructure with smaller HA-particles and a higher specific surface area than heparin-free BioD/coll. However, higher amounts of heparin resulted in a reduced compressive strength. The rheological properties of these cement pastes have been found to be favorable for good handling particularly with regard to their clinical application.},

abstract = {Thermosensitive core-shell magnetic composite particles with a magnetic silica core and a rich poly (N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) shell layer were developed for studying the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a batch system. Various analytical and spectroscopic techniques including SEM, FT-IR, VSM and DSC were used to characterize the adsorbents prepared in this study. The combined effects of operating parameters such as initial temperature, pH and initial BSA concentration on the adsorption were analyzed using response surface methodology. The optimum conditions were 40°C, pH 4.68, and initial BSA concentration 2.0mg/mL. Desorption experiments were conducted by altering the system temperature where a high recovery rate of protein was obtained. The separation process developed here indicates that the dual-responsive smart adsorbent could be an ideal candidate for the separation of protein.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of combined (double contrast) use of superparamagnetic iron particles (SPIOs) and gadolinium (Gd) in liver MR imaging. Material and Methods: Unenhanced, Gd-enhanced, SPIO-enhanced, and both SPIO- and Gd-enhanced images were acquired at 1.5 T. Twenty patients with previously detected liver lesions were included. Fast SE-STIR, and breath-hold true FISP, fat-suppressed T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained with all techniques. Lesion count was assessed by consensus reading. Results: Collective evaluation of all MR sequences revealed 61 lesions in 16 patients; SPIO-enhanced MR detected lesions with a sensitivity of 95{\%} (n=58). The sensitivity of unenhanced MR imaging was 90{\%} (n=55). There was no statistical difference between SPIO-enhanced and unenhanced MR images. From single sequences, the greatest number of lesions was detected with the SPIO-enhanced fast SE-STIR sequence (n=56, sensitivity 92{\%}). By using the fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequence, Gd-enhanced and both SPIO- and Gd-enhanced MR images demonstrated sensitivities of 77{\%} (n=47) and 80{\%} (n=49), respectively. Despite the combined use of both contrast media, this sequence was significantly less sensitive in lesion detection when compared to SPIO-enhanced imaging. Conclusion: SPIO-enhanced MR imaging was the most sensitive method in lesion detection. The benefit of the combined use of SPIO and Gd was negligible.},

The spatial resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy techniques such as Lorentz TEM (LTEM) and off-axis electron holography are well suited to analysis of the magnetic domain structure and magnetization behavior of these magnetic nanostructures and thin films. In this article the various techniques that are applicable are described, including the qualitative LTEM imaging modes and the differential phase contrast technique. In addition, quantitative methods for mapping the magnetic induction via phase reconstruction are discussed. In each case the advantages and limitations are presented. Application of the techniques to various types of magnetic structures is then presented, and the article ends with a short summary and a discussion of future developments in this field.},

Different morphology, from spheres to ellipsoidal particles with axial ratio up to approximately 10, was obtained by adding to the initial solution increasing amounts of phosphate anions up to 7 x 10(-3) M. The main targets of this work are the reduction in particle size and precipitation time and the increase of the particles axial ratio, keeping a narrow particle size distribution, in comparison to other methods previously developed to obtain homogenous alpha-Fe2O3 particles. A detailed analysis of the reaction products and a systematic study of the influence of the different precipitation conditions on the characteristics of the resulting particles have been carried out. Finally, some information on the formation mechanism of the ellipsoidal hematite particles in the iron (III) salt-urea-phosphate system is also given. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

These Janus nanoparticles are dispersed stably as individual particles at high pH values and low temperatures, but can self-assemble at low pH values (PSSNa) or at high temperatures ({\textgreater}31 degrees C) (PNIPAM) to form stable dispersions of clusters of approximately 80-100 nm in hydrodynamic diameter. The Janus nanoparticle compositions were verified using FTIR and XPS, and their structures observed directly by TEM. Their clustering behavior is analyzed by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements.},

abstract = {Although the mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) is precipitated biochemically by bacteria, protists, and a variety of animals, it has not been documented previously in human tissue. Using an ultrasensitive superconducting magnetometer in a clean-lab environment, we have detected the presence of ferromagnetic material in a variety of tissues from the human brain. Magnetic particle extracts from solubilized brain tissues examined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and elemental analyses identify minerals in the magnetite-maghemite family, with many of the crystal morphologies and structures resembling strongly those precipitated by magnetotactic bacteria and fish. These magnetic and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements imply the presence of a minimum of 5 million single-domain crystals per gram for most tissues in the brain and greater than 100 million crystals per gram for pia and dura. Magnetic property data indicate the crystals are in clumps of between 50 and 100 particles. Biogenic magnetite in the human brain may account for high-field saturation effects observed in the T1 and T2 values of magnetic resonance imaging and, perhaps, for a variety of biological effects of low-frequency magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HAp) powder was treated with gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane (gamma-MPS) using standard techniques in both non-polar and polar systems. Infrared spectra (DRIFT) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the presence of gamma-MPS on the surface of the HAp filler particles. Series of experimental composites consisting of bisphenol-a-glycidyl methacrylate (BisGMA) based resin and untreated or treated HAp filler were produced to determine the mechanical properties and in vitro bioactivity. The incorporation of HAp filler into the BisGMA base resin had an enhancing effect on the flexural strength and Young's modulus of the base resin, the latter being increased by a factor of three. The mechanical properties of the filled resin were not affected by the surface treatment of the HAp, but filler loading was found to have a significant effect on Young's modulus. Higher proportions of silane-treated HAp of smaller particle size could be incorporated in the monomer phase giving rise to composites of higher stiffness. Examination of the fracture surfaces showed that the silanized HAp particles maintained better contact with the polymer matrix. In vitro study revealed that the composites incorporating silanized HAp formed a compact and continuous calcium phosphate layer on their surface after 4 weeks immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF).},

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HAp) powder was treated with gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane (gamma-MPS) using standard techniques in both non-polar and polar systems. Infrared spectra (DRIFT) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the presence of gamma-MPS on the surface of the HAp filler particles. Series of experimental composites consisting of bisphenol-a-glycidyl methacrylate (BisGMA) based resin and untreated or treated HAp filler were produced to determine the mechanical properties and in vitro bioactivity. The incorporation of HAp filler into the BisGMA base resin had an enhancing effect on the flexural strength and Young's modulus of the base resin, the latter being increased by a factor of three. The mechanical properties of the filled resin were not affected by the surface treatment of the HAp, but filler loading was found to have a significant effect on Young's modulus. Higher proportions of silane-treated HAp of smaller particle size could be incorporated in the monomer phase giving rise to composites of higher stiffness. Examination of the fracture surfaces showed that the silanized HAp particles maintained better contact with the polymer matrix. In vitro study revealed that the composites incorporating silanized HAp formed a compact and continuous calcium phosphate layer on their surface after 4 weeks immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF).},

abstract = {Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a very powerful technique, which can potentially be used to detect and localize the magnetic fields arising from nanoscopic magnetic domains, such as magnetic nanoparticles. However, in order to achieve this, we must be able to use MFM to discriminate between magnetic forces arising from the magnetic nanoparticles and nonmagnetic forces from other particles and sample features. Unfortunately, MFM can show a significant response even for nonmagnetic nanoparticles, giving rise to potentially misleading results. The literature to date lacks evidence for MFM detection of magnetic nanoparticles with nonmagnetic nanoparticles as a control. In this work, we studied magnetite particles of two sizes and with a silica shell, and compared them to nonmagnetic metallic and silica nanoparticles. We found that even on conducting, grounded substrates, significant electrostatic interaction between atomic force microscopy probes and nanoparticles can be detected, causing nonmagnetic signals that might be mistaken for a true MFM response. Nevertheless, we show that MFM can be used to discriminate between magnetic and nonmagnetic nanoparticles by using an electromagnetic shielding technique or by analysis of the phase shift data. On the basis of our experimental evidence we propose a methodology that enables MFM to be reliably used to study unknown samples containing magnetic nanoparticles, and correctly interpret the data obtained.},

abstract = {Mms6 is a dominant protein that tightly associates with the surface of bacterial magnetites in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. The protein has previously been shown to mediate the formation of uniform magnetite crystals of cubo-octahedral morphology consisting of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal faces with a narrow size distribution during chemical magnetite synthesis. In order to understand the role of this protein in chemical magnetite synthesis, magnetite formation was investigated using synthetic peptides mimicking the Mms6 protein. Particles that were synthesized in the presence of short peptides harbouring the C-terminal acidic region of Mms6 exhibited a spherical morphology with circularities of 0.70-0.90 similar to those of bacterial magnetites and particles formed in the presence of the Mms6 protein. In contrast, a rectangular morphology with circularities of 0.60-0.85 were obtained when other peptides were used for synthesis. The results indicated that the C-terminal region of the Mms6 protein has significant control over the morphology of magnetite crystals in the chemical synthetic method. This method can, therefore, be useful as an alternative method of controlling the size and morphology of magnetite crystals under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Abnormal interactions and misfolding of synaptic proteins in the nervous system are being extensively explored as important pathogenic events resulting in neurodegeneration in various neurological disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In AD, misfolded amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, accumulates in the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum and extracellularly as plaques. In contrast, in PD and DLB cases there is abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies, axons, and synapses. Furthermore, in DLB, Abeta 1-42 may promote alpha-synuclein accumulation and neurodegeneration. The central event leading to synaptic and neuronal loss in these diseases is not completely clear yet; however, recent advances in the field suggest that nerve damage might result from the conversion of nontoxic monomers to toxic oligomers and protofibrils. The mechanisms by which misfolded Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might lead to synapse loss are currently under investigation. Several lines of evidence support the possibility that Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might interact to cause mitochondrial and plasma membrane damage upon translocation of protofibrils to the membranes. Accumulation of Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane might result in the release of cytochrome C with the subsequent activation of the apoptosis cascade. Conversely, the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with AD and PD may also lead to increased membrane permeability and cytochrome C release, which promotes Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomerization and neurodegeneration. Together, these studies suggest that the translocation of misfolded proteins to the mitochondrial membrane might play an important role in either triggering or perpetuating neurodegeneration. The insights obtained from the characterization of this process may be applied to the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in other neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. New evidence may also provide a rationale for the mitochondrial membrane as a target for therapy in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.},

SEM observation indicates that the immature coccolith units at the earliest stage were not perfectly fixed on the organic base plates and several units were often lacked. The all units showed platy morphology and often lay parallel to the organic base plate. Their crystal orientations were close to that of the mature R units. With further growth, the platy morphology changes to a trapezoid to anvil-shape for both units, resulting in the interlocking structure of VR units. Morphological analyses present that the edges of the platy crystals parallel to the organic base plate were estimated as [Formula: see text], and their inner/upper surfaces were estimated as [Formula: see text]. As they interlocked further, R units inclined more outward to develop the inner tube elements with [Formula: see text] and then each unit develops differently distal and proximal shield elements, which are respectively estimated as [Formula: see text] in the distal view and [Formula: see text] planes in the proximal view. Based on the above results, the formation of different coccolith units and their growth were discussed.},

Both iron deficiency and excess during the early weeks of life can have severe effects on neurodevelopment that may persist into adulthood and may not be corrected by restoration of normal iron levels. This article provides a succinct overview of our current understanding of the extent to which newborns, particularly premature newborns, are able (or not able) to regulate their iron status according to physiologic need. Postnatal development of factors important to iron homeostasis such as intestinal transport, extracellular transport, cellular uptake and storage, intracellular regulation, and systemic control are examined. Also reviewed are how factors peculiar to the sick and premature neonate can further adversely influence iron homeostasis and exacerbate iron-induced oxidative stress, predispose the infant to bacterial infections, and, thus, compromise his or her clinical situation further. The article concludes with a discussion of the areas of relative ignorance that require urgent investigation to rectify our lack of understanding of iron homeostasis in what is a critical stage of development.},

abstract = {Adverse effects of viral vectors, instability of naked DNA, cytotoxicity and low transfection of cationic lipids, cationic polymers and other synthetic vectors are currently severe limitations in gene therapy. In addition to targeting a specific cell type, an ideal nonviral vector must manifest an efficient endosomal escape, render sufficient protection of DNA in the cytosol and help provide an easy passage of cytosolic DNA to the nucleus. Virus-like size calcium phosphate nanoparticles have been found to overcome many of these limitations in delivering genes to the nucleus of specific cells. This review has focused on some applications of DNA-loaded calcium phosphate nanoparticles as nonviral vectors in gene delivery, and their potential use in gene therapy, as well as highlighting the mechanistic studies to probe the reason for high transfection efficiency of the vector. It has been demonstrated that calcium ions play an important role in endosomal escape, cytosolic stability and enhanced nuclear uptake of DNA through nuclear pore complexes. The special role of exogenous calcium ions to overcome obstacles in practical realization of this field suggests that calcium phosphate nanoparticles are not 'me too' synthetic vectors and can be designated as second-generation nonviral vectors for gene therapy.},

abstract = {Proliferation and differentiation of cells are known to be influenced by the physical properties of the extracellular environment. Previous studies examining biophysics underlying cell response to matrix stiffness utilized a two-dimensional (2D) culture format, which is not representative of the three-dimensional (3D) tissue environment in vivo. We report on the effect of 3D matrix modulus on human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC) differentiation. hBMSCs underwent osteogenic differentiation in poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels of all modulus (300-fold modulus range, from 0.2 kPa to 59 kPa) in the absence of osteogenic differentiation supplements. This osteogenic differentiation was modulus-dependent and was enhanced in stiffer gels. Osteogenesis in these matrices required integrin-protein ligation since osteogenesis was inhibited by soluble Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate-Serine peptide, which blocks integrin receptors. Immunostained images revealed lack of well-defined actin filaments and microtubules in the encapsulated cells. Disruption of mechanosensing elements downstream of integrin binding that have been identified from 2D culture such as actin filaments, myosin II contraction, and RhoA kinase did not abrogate hBMSC material-driven osteogenic differentiation in 3D. These data show that increased hydrogel modulus enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in 3D scaffolds but that hBMSCs did not use the same mechanosensing pathways that have been identified in 2D culture.},

The superparamagnetic particles actually used are constituted by solid cores (diameter of 5-15 nm), generally coated by a thick polysaccharidic layer (hydrodynamic radii of 30-100 nm), and formulated by direct coprecipitation of iron salts in the presence of polymeric material. To better control the synthesis, we attempted to formulate new stable uncoated superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Colloids were generated by coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of iron salts and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) solution. The influence of parameters such as media composition, iron media, injection fluxes, Fe and TMAOH concentrations, temperature, and oxygen on size, magnetic and magnetic resonance relaxometric properties, and colloidal stability of particles were evaluated. We have determined the relative importance of these parameters as well as the optimal conditions for obtaining uncoated stable particles with an average size of 5 nm and interesting relaxivities. The interpretation of the observed limits takes into account diffusibilities of reactants and product, feeding rates of reactants, and surface properties of nanoparticles.

The presence of cobalt increases the coercive field of the magnetosomes--that is, the field necessary to reverse their magnetization--by 36-45{\%}, depending on the strain and the cobalt content. With elemental analysis, X-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, we estimate the cobalt content to be between 0.2 and 1.4{\%}. These findings provide an important advance in designing biologically synthesized nanoparticles with useful highly tuned magnetic properties.},

abstract = {The need to analyze and understand energy consumption in relation to households' activity patterns is vital for developing policy means that contribute to an energy efficient life and what people would deem as a "good" everyday life. To do this we need to learn more about how energy use is a part of everyday life; this article contributes to that objective. We use the time-geographic diary approach together with interviews to analyze everyday life as a totality. From household members' time diaries, we can analyze and learn about when, where, and what energy-related activities occur in a household context and by whom (and in what social context) they are performed. We discuss the importance of relating information and feedback to households' everyday activities, in order to make it relevant to households. Through our method we discover and visualize activity patterns in a household during a given period. The method is also useful to households as a reflective tool when discussing families' daily lives in relation to energy consumption. The method gives direct feedback to households and the information is relevant since it emanates from their own reported activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Piwowar2013,
abstract = {Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the "citation benefit". Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 5{\%} to 13{\%}) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30{\%}. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20{\%} of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},
